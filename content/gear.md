Here's the tech I use.

## Computers

### Laptop - Asus X13 Flow 2022

I got this just at the start of 2023, and it's a pretty sweet laptop. I wanted a smaller form factor. Asus cheaps out on the wifi card so I had to swap out the Mediatek wifi card for an Intel one, which improved some of the wifi problems. I've never been happy with bluetooth on Linux, so let's not get into that.

I'd earlier run Fedora on this, but lately I've been using Linux Mint.

Here are the specs for this machine:

1. CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS with Radeon Graphics (16 core) @ 4.935 GHz
2. GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Mobile
3. RAM: 32 GiB
4. Storage: SSD - 1 TB SSD

I also run Windows 11 on this just to play games every now and then.
