What values dictate your life? Organizations claim to have values that guide
them, but what excludes individuals from professing to work with values?

These are my values.

## I Heal

I work towards healing. Software addresses certain voids in the world, if you
must write an application, you are probably doing so after discovering that
something like it doesn't exist. If it does, perhaps you have a different
usecase that it doesn't address.

I seek to heal the processes I am involved in, and in turn, help the people I
work with. I work best when working with others, helping them do what they need
to do in the most efficient way.

## I Include

I abhor bullies. I hate them with my very core. It doesnâ€™t matter to me if
youâ€™re a genius. If you are a bully, your net addition to the team is a
negative.

It doesnâ€™t matter to me who a question comes from when Iâ€™m in a team. We are a
unit. We function as one. Not one question is out of place, and no voice is
unheard.

There is something to be said about divas. But, there is nothing good that comes
out of being one.

## I Learn

I am learning and curious to a fault.

If there is one quasi-fictional/mythological person I relate to, it is Faust.
Given a chance by Mephistopheles, Faust asks for wisdom, at a great price. The
phrase selling your soul originated there, after all. I have the flaws of Faust.
I will constantly learn, with every waking moment.

## I Write

Iâ€™m constantly writing things down. Case in point: this post itself.

Iâ€™m driven to think about documentation and how users perceive them. Iâ€™m always
structuring talks that I give in a way that both entertains and educates.

This philosophy of mine is why I maintain this blog in the first place.

## I Wait

This point exists to teach me that I need to exercise patience. It is a constant
reminder that waiting helps. It is not what makes me happy, but it is a thing I
am working on.
