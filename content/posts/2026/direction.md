I've been doing a lot of thinking about my career trajectory, and I know what I
want to build towards. I want to be a performance engineer, someone who can
really write scalable code and systems. To that end, I want to focus my studies
on these books and topics. I'll update the list here whenever I have changes.
I'll also make notes on these as I read, making blog posts about what I learn.
They won't be directly 1:1 for these books and articles, but I'll do it as a
series of posts showcasing what I learnt.

I'm not sure I'll be able to complete all of them before April, but I want to
finish the most important ones and learn from them to be the best engineer I can
be.

For a comprehensive list of learning resources, see [Distributed Systems
Learning Resources]({{< ref "/distributed-systems.md" >}}).
