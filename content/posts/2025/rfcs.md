I made a thing using AI. I wanted to learn how the internet works using RFCs, and I thought it would
be a cool exercise to use Claude to build an interactive tutorial platform for it.

Head over to [rfc.stonecharioteer.com](https://rfc.stonecharioteer.com) to try it out. I'm planning on
updating it with plenty of RFCs in the upcoming days.

This tutorial site includes:

- Popup glossary for terms
- Diagrams to explain concepts
- Python code snippets to "explain like I'm a pythonista"

This is something I made for myself, and I hope it helps others too!
