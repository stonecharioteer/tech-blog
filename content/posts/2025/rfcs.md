I have always been curious about how the Internet works, and I wanted to read the RFCs that
led up to the modern web one day. Last week, I tried using AI tools to study the RFCs, and
in doing so, I had an idea for a tutorial site to help anyone read and understand the
critical RFCs that helped shape the internet into what it is today.

Head over to [https://rfc.stonecharioteer.com](https://rfc.stonecharioteer.com) to try it out. Today,
the site discusses over 20 RFCs, including, but not limited to, RFCs about HTTP, IPv4, IPv6 and
cryptography.

I wanted to frame each RFC with its own sections on understanding it with:

- modern context,
- a glossary of terms and acronyms,
- python programs to illustrate how this works under the hood,
- docker examples to provide users with live demos they can run on their computers, and,
- diagrams to explain the concepts therein.

I plan to evolve this project out further, and I hope it helps others as well.
This is the first of many projects I have been planning out to improve how I learn.
