I'm not a fan of having to use a MacBook everyday. It is a closed system, you cannot
easily figure out what is wrong with it when things go wrong, and macOS is a resource hog.

I'm unfortunately forced to use a MacBook for work, an M4 MacBook Pro Max (16" inch Display),
and I'm bogged down by how much of it is _different_. Yet, it is not _different enough_ so
as to activate different muscle memories. I've used a Mac before, at Visa, and it was
harder then, because it was an enterprise-governed machine. Before that, my work machine
was a Windows laptop, and I have had enough of Windows to last me a lifetime.

Since leaving Visa (2021), I've exclusively used Linux for work. At ChainSafe, I didn't get a
work laptop so I used my personal machine, an ROG X13 Flow, with Fedora, originally, and eventually
I installed Linux Mint.

A Mac makes me feel _slow_, to be honest. It takes my control away from me, and it also takes my
computer and hides things from me. I remember being unable to understand what's wrong with my old
Macbook, and the official solution was to "[not] charge it from the right USB-c port".

Consider it a blessing that the Magsafe port is back. I use USB-C monitors with passthrough charging now, so
I don't really connect the magsafe charger anymore.

I needed to be productive for my new job, more productive than I've ever been in my career, I think.
And at such a time, this laptop is making me slower. So I set about trying to fix what about this laptop I didn't like.

# The Dock

A long time ago, I installed [a similar dock on my Windows machine,](https://punklabs.com/rocketdock)
I think back in 2008 or 2009. It seemed like a good idea. I can't remember using it much. I don't think I've ever
liked the idea of something taking up 10% of my monitor space. Even with the autohide, it is ridiculously space-occupying.
I never used the dock in the previous mac, and the first thing I did here is autohide it and put it on the left of my screen.
I should probably look into disabling it entirely, but that doesn't seem to be best thing to do.

# Spaces and Window Management

I *abhor* the way spaces are designed in macOS. They're not [user-friendly](https://old.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/tna3wb/macos_spacesvirtual_desktops_suck/)
The way Gnome/KDE does them is simple and easy to navigate. The fact that you need to install third-party tools to get simple window movement shortcuts
working is ridiculous. I'm not sure what I hate more: [`karabiner-elements`](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), [`Spectacle`](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle),
or [`Rectangle`](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle). 

I liked [`AltTab`](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/), because `Cmd-Tab` sucks in terms of user experience. I hate having grouped windows at all. The fact that
`AltTab` comes with a panel that lists all windows is just beautiful.

# My Choices

I started off with the stuff I knew. I installed `iTerm2`, `tmux` and `neovim`. I also spent some time trying out tools like `yabai` and `Alfred.`
