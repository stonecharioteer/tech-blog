There are a couple of ways to reverse a list in python:

```python
my_list = [1,2,3,"apples","banana","fish","chicken"]
reverse_list_one = my_list[::-1]
reverse_list_one = reversed(my_list)
reverse_list_zero = my_list
reverse_list_zero.reverse()
```

Of these three ways, I prefer using `reversed` because it is readable and there's no ambiguity about whether it does it in place or not. It should be obvious to most people that `.reverse()` reverses a list in place,
but I prefer the verbosity of the method that returns a reversed list. It's a stylistic choice.

The `[::-1]` syntax though is unreadable unless you know where it comes from. The syntax is `List[start:stop_at:step_count]`. This can be used to collect items of a list in a specific way. You could use it to collect all the alternate items in a list through `my_list[::2]`, or every third item from the first to the seventh index, through `my_list[0:7:2]` (If you don't want to include the last item, remember that python's list intervals are half-open).

So `[::-1]` means collect all the items in this array but move through it -1 items at a time, meaning, start with the last item first and move backwards.

But which one of these is faster? We can use the timeit module to test this out.

```python
import timeit
import random

my_list = [random.randrange(10**6) for _ in range(10**3)]

trial_1 = timeit.timeit("reversed(my_list)", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list=my_list))
print(trial_1)
my_list_1 = my_list
trial_2 = timeit.timeit("my_list_1.reverse()", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list_1=my_list_1))
print(trial_2)
trial_3 = timeit.timeit("my_list[::-1]", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list=my_list))
print(trial_3)
```

This attempts to reverse a list of a thousand numbers ranging from 0 to a million ten thousand times. On my [X13 Flow laptop](/gear/#laptop---asus-x13-flow-2022) and with python 3.12.3 this gets me the following output:

```
0.0005502169997271267
0.0013474229999701492
0.012336962999597745
```

I'm fairly surprised myself that `reversed` is the fastest way to reverse a list in Python. I half expected to tell you that it'd be the list notation syntax. And it's faster than the in-place method, which isn't surprising since it's not trying to move things around to save memory. [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65540349/time-complexity-of-reversed-in-python-3) shows that it's creating an iterator and not returning a list like the list notation syntax would, so using `list(reversed(my_list))` would be a fairer comparison.


```python
import timeit
import random

my_list = [random.randrange(10**6) for _ in range(10**3)]

trial_1 = timeit.timeit("reversed(my_list)", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list=my_list))
my_list_1 = my_list
trial_2 = timeit.timeit("my_list_1.reverse()", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list_1=my_list_1))
trial_3 = timeit.timeit("my_list[::-1]", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list=my_list))
trial_4 = timeit.timeit("list(reversed(my_list))", number=10**4, globals=dict(my_list=my_list))
print(f"""
{ trial_1= }
{ trial_2= }
{ trial_3= }
{ trial_4= }
""")
```

Now we get a more realistic solution. 

```
 trial_1= 0.0005320420000316517
 trial_2= 0.0013524949999919045
 trial_3= 0.011964209999860032
 trial_4= 0.032413619000180915
```

Honestly though, this doesn't prove anything. If I needed a reversed list to _iterate_ over, the iterator approach with `reversed` is the best way to do it. If I need an in-memory version of it, the list notation syntax is clean. In-place reversal is useful only if I'm completely sure I would like to reverse the list in place. This is useful when the list is perhaps an attribute of a class, for example.
