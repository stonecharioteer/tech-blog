I've left ChainSafe Systems where I spent 25 months working with some of the best minds in the
cryptocurrency world. It was a learning period for me, as most of my career stints have been,
and I've enjoyed my time there.

I'm looking forward to the next journey, and wish the company the best.

{{< warning title="Currently Open to Hire" >}}
I'm currently looking for my next role, and if you'd like to reach out,
here's my [resume](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/blog/releases/latest).

I code in Python, Rust, and some Javascript. I'm looking for challenging
roles in an architect or lead position where you're dealing with distributed
systems that boggle the mind. I've also worked with GenAI and Blockchain in
the last few years. Hit me up if you want to discuss how cool Rust is!
