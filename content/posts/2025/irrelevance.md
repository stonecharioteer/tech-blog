I know what you're thinking. This is another post about how "AI is coming for your jobs". Maybe it is; while I write this, I'm not sure.

I'm at my desk, it's 17:38 and I spent most of the day brain-rotting on YouTube. I know I say I am off YouTube, but lately, I've been
struggling.

I've been trying to regain lost interest in technology, but I'm not doing so well by that. It is hard to really bring into perspective sometimes.
