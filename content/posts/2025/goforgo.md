I have been trying to relearn the Go programming language. I thought it'd be
nice to build a tool that is inspired by
[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) for Go. I see some potential
repos in Github, but I thought I'd try my hand at making my own version using
Claude.

So I built [GoForGo](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/goforgo)

I'm happy with the results thus far.

The goal is to have an interactive terminal application that can take me through
gradual exercises in learning Go. The user isn't expected to know any go prior
to this. You install Go on your machine and then install `goforgo`, using
`goforgo init` to get started.

I've recorded a gif to try and showcase what the tool is like, but go ahead and
try it out for yourselves.
