I have been trying to relearn the Go programming language. I thought it'd be nice to build a tool
that is inspired by [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) for Go.
I see some potential repos in Github, but I thought I'd try my hand at making my own
version using Claude.

I'm happy with the results thus far.

The goal is to have an interactive terminal application that can take me through gradual exercises
in learning Go. The user isn't expected to know any go prior to this. You install Go on your machine
and then install `goforgo`, using `goforgo init` to get started.

I've recorded a gif to try and showcase what the tool is like, but go ahead and try it out for yourselves.
