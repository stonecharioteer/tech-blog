In *The Dark Knight Rises*, we see a retired Bruce Wayne coaxed into "taking a
look" at Lucius Fox's latest creation: a flying version of the Batmobile he
calls "The Bat". Lucius finishes off his introduction telling Bruce the
following:

Bruce is surprised at Lucius's obvious lie, an attempt at modesty. After all,
Lucius was the one who build all of the Batman's gadgets and the face of Wayne
Enterprises.

I've not been able to stop thinking about this scene for the past few weeks.
I have had a lot of personal projects that I've never completed, and this has
been a hard thing on my mind. Was I getting older? Did I lose interest in
these projects? Am I not as creative as I used to be?

These sort of thoughts kept pushing me towards burnout, and I didn't realize what
it was doing until after I took a well deserved break to focus on my health.

I started using Claude Code a while ago, dabbling in using it to build several
things that I would have otherwise not been able to do.

Just to list things off:

1. [A centralized place to store all my
   scripts](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/scripts)
2. [A version of `rustlings` but for
   Go](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/goforgo)
3. [A website through which to read the RFCs that built the
   Internet](https://rfc.stonecharioteer.com)
4. [A self-hosted solution to remember medicine schedules for anyone in the
   family - human or pets](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/sushruta)

And, I haven't written about this yet, but I also managed to migrate *all* the
old posts from my Jekyll and Sphinx-based blogs into Hugo with little effort!

Doing this has been making me feel *productive* again, even though I'm not
directly writing code these days. Instead, it's helping me focus on doing
things for myself, bring into fruition ideas that have never dared voice
themselves.

I've read a lot about how LLMs and Coding Agents can take away jobs, and it
surely *does* feel that way, because as of this post, I'm still looking for a
job.

However, it is also true that these tools are *enabling*. They allow you to do
things you wouldn't otherwise try to.

Case in point: I managed to "fix" the touchpad on my laptop. I am able to pinch
to zoom, use three finger swipe to go forward and back in webpages, and I'm
able to use all the multimedia keys on my keyboards with ease.

Did I mention that I'm running Linux?

*And*, my laptop now supports native screen rotation. The Asus X13 Flow has an
accelerator that never worked well on Linux, at least not in a tiling window
manager and now, it works with ease! I am also able to extend my `Rofi` config
to have scripts for things I didn't ever think I'd get around to, like being
able to copy my `dunst` notifications to memory.

And, most importantly, I'm able to fix problems in my neovim config without
bothering to dig into the minutae of the plugins I use.

I was thinking about this even when using some devices and services I didn't
have any hand in building. Like my Shokz OpenSwim Pro 2 bone conduction
headphones for example. These are the headphones I use during swimming, and I
used Claude to whip up some scripts to rip my audiobooks from Audible and split
them into 5 minute mp3 segments for use in the pool. This is very specific
usecase, but Shokz comes with an app that allows you to tweak settings on the
headphones. You can also skip ahead or go back in the track list, which is
useful since the device is like the iPod Shuffle, you can't see what track
you're on, which is a bummer when you're listening to an audiobook. The app
allows you to skip ahead and back, but it doesn't show the name of the file
that's currently playing. It's not that this isn't possible. It definitely is.
But the developers making this app didn't have the time or the energy to code
this feature. As I was listening to something, I realized that with a coding
agent, they could have gotten around to this after all. It would have made the
experience perfect.

I can't remember the list of services that would have gotten better if the
developers got more time or were better staffed. It's funny saying this as the
entire industry is facing the biggest job crisis in its history, but it is
true. I faced it myself, honestly. I was too busy to get some things done and I
didn't have any help. I only blamed myself, telling myself that I was too slow.
The sentiment seemed to be echoed at some of the companies I've worked at. This
only pushed me towards burnout, but it is really hopeful to see what potential
a coding agent can have in the right hands.

I've talked about burnout with some friends, but I've never publically written
about it before. I thought perhaps I lost my love for programming. Turns out I
just needed a less busy mind to learn to love building things again.
