I'm splitting my website into different subdomains. This one,
[`https://tech.stonecharioteer.com`](https://tech.stonecharioteer.com) will host
all my posts on software and technology. I want separate themes for each portion
of my website, and I figured subdomains will suit me best (for now).

## Housekeeping

I'm using Hugo this time around. I'm still interested in using ReStructeredText over Markdown,
but I'm trying to put out more content in the least-resistance possible, so for now, this works for me.
The PaperMod theme is simple enough, and I am happy with it.
