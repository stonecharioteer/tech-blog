## Kubernetes and Helm

### ChartMuseum - Helm Chart Repository
- [ChartMuseum - Helm Chart Repository](https://chartmuseum.com/)
- Open-source Helm chart repository server with API
- Supports multiple storage backends and authentication
- Essential for managing private Helm charts in organizations

### ChartMuseum Features
- **Multi-backend Storage**: Local filesystem, cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure)
- **Authentication**: Basic auth, bearer token, and custom auth plugins
- **API Support**: RESTful API for chart management
- **High Availability**: Designed for production deployment
- **Chart Versioning**: Proper semantic versioning for chart releases

## Technology History

### AMD's Rise, Fall, and Revival
- [The Rise, Fall and Revival of AMD | TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/article/2043-amd-rise-fall-revival-history/)
- Comprehensive history of AMD's journey in the semiconductor industry
- From early competition with Intel to near-bankruptcy to current success
- Demonstrates importance of innovation, strategic decisions, and execution

### Key Historical Periods
- **Early Years (1969-1990s)**: Founding and initial competition with Intel
- **Athlon Era (1990s-2000s)**: Technical leadership and market success
- **Decline (2000s-2010s)**: Strategic missteps and financial struggles
- **Ryzen Revival (2010s-present)**: Return to competitiveness with new architecture

## Kubernetes Operations

### Pod Scaling Behavior
- [Why does scaling down a deployment seem to always remove the newest pods?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51467314/why-does-scaling-down-a-deployment-seem-to-always-remove-the-newest-pods)
- Kubernetes removes newest pods first when scaling down deployments
- Based on pod readiness and age for predictable scaling behavior
- Ensures applications maintain stability during scale-down operations

### Scaling Algorithm
- **Readiness Priority**: Unready pods removed before ready pods
- **Age Priority**: Among ready pods, newer pods removed first
- **Stability**: Keeps longer-running, proven stable pods
- **Predictability**: Consistent behavior across scale-down operations

## Key Takeaways

- **Infrastructure Management**: Tools like ChartMuseum are essential for enterprise Kubernetes deployments
- **Corporate Resilience**: AMD's story shows how companies can recover from near-failure through innovation
- **System Design**: Kubernetes' scaling behavior prioritizes stability and predictability
- **Learning Resources**: Understanding both technical details and business history provides broader context

These topics span from practical DevOps tools to business strategy and system design principles, showing the interconnected nature of technology, business, and operational considerations.
