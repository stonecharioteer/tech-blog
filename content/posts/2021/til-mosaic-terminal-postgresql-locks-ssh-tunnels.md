## Terminal and Development Tools

### Mosaic Terminal Workspace
- [GitHub - mosaic-org/mosaic: Terminal workspace (WIP)](https://github.com/mosaic-org/mosaic)
- Modern terminal workspace written in Rust
- Provides tiling window manager functionality for terminal sessions
- Work-in-progress project for enhanced terminal productivity
- Alternative to traditional terminal multiplexers like tmux and screen

### Terminal Workspace Benefits
- **Tiling Layout**: Automatic window arrangement and management
- **Session Management**: Persistent terminal sessions across disconnections
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with contemporary programming languages and patterns
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for customization and additional functionality
