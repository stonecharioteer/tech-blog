## Web Components and Dark Mode

### Dark Mode Toggle Custom Element
- [GitHub - GoogleChromeLabs/dark-mode-toggle](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/dark-mode-toggle)
- Custom HTML element for adding dark mode toggles to websites
- Developed by Google Chrome Labs for easy dark mode implementation
- Standards-based web component that works across frameworks

## Key Features

### Easy Integration
- **Custom Element**: Use as simple HTML tag `<dark-mode-toggle>`
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any framework or vanilla HTML
- **No Dependencies**: Self-contained web component
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility best practices

### User Experience
- **Persistent Preference**: Remembers user's dark mode choice
- **System Integration**: Respects OS-level dark mode preferences
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides smooth visual transitions

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript as fallback

## Dark Mode Best Practices

### Design Considerations
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast in both modes
- **Image Handling**: Consider image visibility in dark themes
- **Brand Colors**: Adapt brand colors for dark backgrounds
- **User Choice**: Always allow user override of system preferences

### Implementation Patterns
- **CSS Variables**: Use custom properties for easy theme switching
- **Semantic Colors**: Define colors by purpose, not appearance
- **Component Isolation**: Ensure components work in both modes
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly in both light and dark modes

## Key Takeaways

- **User Experience**: Dark mode is becoming an expected feature
- **Web Standards**: Custom elements provide reusable, standards-based solutions
- **Accessibility**: Consider user preferences and system settings
- **Developer Experience**: Well-designed components simplify implementation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build features that work with or without JavaScript

This component demonstrates how web standards and thoughtful design can make complex features (like theme switching) simple to implement while maintaining excellent user experience and accessibility.
