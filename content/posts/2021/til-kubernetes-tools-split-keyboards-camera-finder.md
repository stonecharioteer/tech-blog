## Kubernetes Productivity Tools

### kubectx - Cluster and Namespace Switching
- [GitHub - ahmetb/kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/)
- Fast way to switch between Kubernetes clusters and namespaces
- Essential tool for managing multiple Kubernetes environments
- Includes both `kubectx` for clusters and `kubens` for namespaces

### KubeLens - Lightweight Kubernetes Lens
- [GitHub - kubelens/kubelens](https://github.com/kubelens/kubelens)
- Lightweight lens for applications running in Kubernetes
- Terminal-based interface for Kubernetes cluster management
- Alternative to heavier GUI tools for quick cluster inspection

### Kubeless - Serverless Framework
- [Kubeless](https://kubeless.io/)
- Kubernetes-native serverless framework
- Deploy functions as Kubernetes resources
- Supports multiple programming languages and event triggers

### Kui - Kubernetes CLI Enhancement
- [Kui](https://kui.tools/)
- Hybrid command-line/GUI tool for Kubernetes
- Combines CLI power with visual elements
- Interactive tables, forms, and visualizations for kubectl commands

### Private Registry Image Pulling
- [Pull an Image from a Private Registry | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)
- Official documentation on using private container registries
- Secret creation and pod configuration for private images
- Essential for enterprise Kubernetes deployments

## Ergonomic Hardware

### Split Keyboards Collection
- [GitHub - diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards)
- Comprehensive collection of ergonomic split keyboards
- Various layouts, build guides, and firmware options
- Great resource for ergonomic typing solutions

### kinT - Kinesis Controller Replacement
- [GitHub - kinx-project/kint](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint)
- Modern controller replacement for Kinesis keyboards
- Adds USB-C, improved firmware, and additional features
- Shows evolution of ergonomic keyboard technology

### Split Keyboard Benefits
- **Ergonomics**: Natural shoulder and wrist positioning
- **Customization**: Programmable layouts and key mapping
- **Health**: Reduced strain from unnatural hand positioning
- **Productivity**: Optimized layouts for specific use cases

## Interesting Tools

### Stolen Camera Finder
- [Stolen Camera Finder](https://www.stolencamerafinder.com/)
- Service to help find stolen cameras using EXIF data
- Searches photo sharing sites for images with matching camera serial numbers
- Demonstrates practical applications of metadata analysis

### How It Works
- **EXIF Data**: Digital cameras embed serial numbers in image metadata
- **Photo Scanning**: Service crawls photo sharing sites for EXIF data
- **Serial Matching**: Compares found serial numbers with stolen camera database
- **Privacy Implications**: Shows how much information photos can reveal

## Key Takeaways

- **Tool Ecosystem**: Kubernetes has rich tooling ecosystem beyond kubectl
- **Workflow Optimization**: Specialized tools can significantly improve daily workflows
- **Ergonomic Investment**: Good hardware can improve long-term health and productivity
- **Metadata Awareness**: Digital photos contain more information than visible content
- **Community Resources**: Open-source collections provide valuable curated information

These discoveries span from practical development tools to hardware considerations and interesting applications of data analysis, showing the diverse landscape of modern technology tools and concerns.
