## Labella - Label Positioning Library

[labella Â· PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/labella/)

Python library for solving the label overlap problem in data visualizations:

### The Problem:
When creating charts with many data points, labels often overlap, making them unreadable.

### Labella's Solution:
- **Force Simulation**: Uses physics-based algorithms to position labels
- **Overlap Avoidance**: Ensures labels don't overlap while staying near data points
- **Flexible Layout**: Supports various chart types and orientations
- **Customizable**: Adjust force parameters for different layouts

### Use Cases:
- Scatter plots with many points
- Timeline visualizations
- Network diagrams
- Any chart where label positioning is challenging

Perfect for data scientists and visualization developers who need clean, readable charts.
