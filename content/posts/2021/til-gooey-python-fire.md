## Gooey - Turn CLI into GUI

[GitHub - chriskiehl/Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) - Turn (almost)
any Python command line program into a full GUI application with one line.

This is incredibly useful for creating user-friendly interfaces for command-line
tools without having to write GUI code from scratch.

## Python Fire - Auto-generate CLIs

[GitHub - google/python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - Python
Fire is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs)
from absolutely any Python object.

Python Fire can automatically generate CLIs from classes, functions, or even
entire modules, making it super easy to expose Python functionality via command
line.
