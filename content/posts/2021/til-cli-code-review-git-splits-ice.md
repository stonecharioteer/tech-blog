## CLI Code Review Workflow

[Code Review from the Command Line - Bits, Bytes, and Words](https://blog.jez.io/cli-code-review)

Excellent guide on performing code reviews entirely from the command line:

### Key Benefits:
- **Faster Navigation**: Jump between files quickly with terminal tools
- **Familiar Environment**: Stay in your preferred terminal setup
- **Git Integration**: Leverage powerful git commands for review
- **Scripting**: Automate repetitive review tasks
- **Offline Capability**: Review code without web interface dependencies

### Tools and Techniques:
- Using `git log`, `git diff`, and `git show` effectively
- Terminal-based diff viewers
- Command-line GitHub integration
- Review workflow automation scripts

## GitHub-Style Split Diffs in Terminal
