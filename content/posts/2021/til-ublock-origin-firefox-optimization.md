## uBlock Origin and Browser Performance

### Firefox vs Other Browsers
- [uBlock Origin works best on Firefox](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox)
- Firefox provides superior APIs for content blocking compared to Chrome and other browsers
- Chrome's Manifest V3 limitations significantly impact ad blocker effectiveness
- Firefox maintains support for the more powerful webRequest API

## Technical Differences

### API Capabilities
- **Firefox**: Full access to webRequest API for comprehensive filtering
- **Chrome**: Limited by Manifest V3 restrictions on content blocking
- **Performance**: Firefox allows more efficient filtering algorithms
- **Privacy**: Better protection against tracking and fingerprinting

### Extension Architecture
- Firefox's extension system designed with privacy and user control in mind
- Chrome's restrictions prioritize performance over blocking capability
- Firefox allows dynamic filtering rules that Chrome cannot support
- Better memory management for large filter lists

## Key Takeaways

- **Browser Choice Matters**: The browser significantly impacts extension capabilities
- **Privacy vs Performance**: Firefox prioritizes user privacy and control
- **Extension Development**: API limitations affect what extensions can accomplish
- **User Experience**: More effective ad blocking leads to better browsing experience

This is particularly relevant for users who prioritize privacy and ad blocking effectiveness. The architectural differences between browsers have real-world implications for extension functionality and user privacy protection.
