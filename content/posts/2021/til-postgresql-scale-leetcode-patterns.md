## Database Scaling

### Breaking PostgreSQL at Scale
- [Breaking PostgreSQL at Scale â€” Christophe Pettus - YouTube](https://youtu.be/XUkTUMZRBE8)
- Comprehensive talk on PostgreSQL performance bottlenecks at large scale
- Common scaling pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Real-world examples from production systems handling massive datasets

### Key PostgreSQL Scaling Insights
- **Connection Pooling**: Critical for high-concurrency applications
- **Query Optimization**: Index strategy becomes crucial at scale
- **Partitioning**: Table partitioning for managing large datasets
- **Replication**: Read replicas and failover strategies
- **Monitoring**: Essential metrics for identifying bottlenecks

## Algorithm Learning

### LeetCode Problem Patterns
- [GitHub - SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns)
- Curated list of LeetCode questions grouped by algorithmic patterns
- Organized approach to learning problem-solving techniques
- Helps identify common patterns across different problems

### Pattern Categories
- **Two Pointers**: Array and string manipulation problems
- **Sliding Window**: Substring and subarray problems
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization and counting problems
- **Tree Traversal**: Binary tree and graph problems
- **Backtracking**: Combinatorial and constraint satisfaction problems

## Key Takeaways

- **Database Scaling**: Understanding bottlenecks before they become critical
- **Pattern Recognition**: Algorithmic problem-solving benefits from pattern identification
- **Systematic Learning**: Organized approaches to complex topics improve retention
- **Production Ready**: Both database optimization and algorithmic thinking are essential for real-world applications

These resources provide both practical database management skills and fundamental algorithmic problem-solving techniques - essential for building scalable systems.
