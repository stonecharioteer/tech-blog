## MontyDB - Pure Python MongoDB

[GitHub - davidlatwe/montydb](https://github.com/davidlatwe/montydb) - Monty,
Mongo tinified. MongoDB implemented in Python!

MontyDB is a pure Python implementation of MongoDB that provides:

- MongoDB-like API and query syntax
- In-memory or file-based storage
- No external dependencies (no need to install MongoDB server)
- Perfect for testing, prototyping, and lightweight applications
- Support for most MongoDB operations and queries

This is particularly useful for:

- Unit testing applications that use MongoDB
- Development environments where you don't want to install MongoDB
- Embedded applications that need document storage
- Learning MongoDB concepts without server setup
