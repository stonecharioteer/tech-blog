## Slurm Workload Manager

[Slurm Workload Manager - Quick Start User Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html)

A highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for Linux clusters:

### What is Slurm:
- **Job Scheduler**: Manages and schedules computational jobs across cluster nodes
- **Resource Manager**: Allocates compute resources (CPUs, memory, GPUs) efficiently  
- **Workload Manager**: Handles queues, priorities, and job dependencies
- **Open Source**: Free and widely adopted in HPC environments

### Key Features:

#### **Job Management:**
- **Batch Jobs**: Submit scripts to run when resources are available
- **Interactive Jobs**: Allocate resources for interactive computing sessions
- **Array Jobs**: Efficiently handle large numbers of similar tasks
- **Job Dependencies**: Chain jobs together with dependency relationships

#### **Resource Allocation:**
- **CPU Management**: Allocate specific number of cores per job
- **Memory Control**: Manage memory allocation and limits
- **GPU Support**: Schedule and manage GPU resources
- **Network Resources**: Handle interconnect and bandwidth allocation

#### **Scheduling Policies:**
- **Fair Share**: Ensure equitable resource distribution among users
- **Priority Queues**: Different priority levels for different job types
- **Backfill**: Optimize resource utilization by filling gaps in schedule
- **Preemption**: Higher priority jobs can preempt lower priority ones

### Common Use Cases:

#### **High-Performance Computing:**
- **Scientific Computing**: Physics simulations, climate modeling
- **Machine Learning**: Training large models on GPU clusters
- **Bioinformatics**: Genomic analysis and computational biology
- **Engineering**: CFD, FEA, and other computational engineering tasks

#### **Academic Research:**
- **University Clusters**: Shared computing resources for researchers
- **Laboratory Computing**: Dedicated resources for specific research groups
- **Student Projects**: Managed access to computing resources

### Basic Commands:
```bash
sbatch job_script.sh    # Submit batch job
squeue                  # View job queue
scancel job_id          # Cancel job
sinfo                   # View cluster information
salloc                  # Allocate resources interactively
```

### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Manages clusters from small to massive scale
- **Efficiency**: Maximizes resource utilization
- **Fairness**: Ensures equitable access to resources
- **Flexibility**: Supports diverse workload types and requirements

Slurm is essential infrastructure for any organization running computational workloads on Linux clusters, providing the foundation for efficient resource management in HPC environments.
