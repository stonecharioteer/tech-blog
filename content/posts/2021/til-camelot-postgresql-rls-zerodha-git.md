## Camelot - PDF Table Extraction

[Camelot: PDF Table Extraction for Humans](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

Python library for extracting tables from PDF files with high accuracy:

### Key Features:
- **Multiple Parsing Methods**: Stream and Lattice parsers for different table types
- **High Accuracy**: Better results than traditional PDF parsing tools
- **Pandas Integration**: Direct conversion to pandas DataFrames
- **Visual Debugging**: Plot detected table areas for validation
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune detection parameters

### Usage Examples:
```python
import camelot

# Extract tables from PDF
tables = camelot.read_pdf('document.pdf')
print(f"Found {tables.n} tables")

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
df = tables[0].df

# Export to various formats
tables.export('output.csv', f='csv')
tables.export('output.xlsx', f='excel')
```

### When to Use:
- Financial reports with tabular data
- Research papers with data tables
- Government documents with statistics
- Any structured data trapped in PDFs

## PostgreSQL Row Level Security for Multi-Tenancy

[Multi-tenant data isolation with PostgreSQL Row Level Security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/multi-tenant-data-isolation-with-postgresql-row-level-security/)

Advanced PostgreSQL feature for implementing secure multi-tenant applications:

### What is Row Level Security (RLS):
- **Fine-Grained Access**: Control access at the row level within tables
- **Policy-Based**: Define security policies for different user types
- **Transparent**: Application code doesn't need complex filtering logic
- **Performance**: Database-level enforcement with optimized execution

### Implementation Pattern:
```sql
-- Enable RLS on table
ALTER TABLE customer_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for tenant isolation
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON customer_data
    FOR ALL TO tenant_user
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::integer);

-- Set tenant context in application
SET app.current_tenant = '123';
```

### Benefits:
- **Data Isolation**: Strong tenant boundaries
- **Security**: Prevents data leaks between tenants
- **Simplicity**: Reduces application complexity
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements

### Use Cases:
- SaaS applications with multiple customers
- Healthcare systems with patient data isolation
- Financial applications with account separation
- Any system requiring strict data boundaries
