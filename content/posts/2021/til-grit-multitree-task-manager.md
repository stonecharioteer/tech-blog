- [GitHub - climech/grit](https://github.com/climech/grit)
- Personal task manager built around multitree data structure
- Allows tasks to belong to multiple hierarchies simultaneously
- Command-line interface for efficient task management

## Key Features

### Multitree Organization
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Tasks organized in tree-like hierarchies
- **Multiple Parents**: Tasks can belong to multiple parent categories
- **Flexible Relationships**: Create complex relationships between tasks and projects
- **Context Switching**: View tasks from different organizational perspectives

### Command-Line Interface
- **Fast Entry**: Quick task creation and updates
- **Search and Filter**: Efficient task discovery and filtering
- **Bulk Operations**: Batch updates and modifications
- **Scriptable**: Integration with other command-line tools and workflows

### Data Structure Benefits
- **Non-Linear Organization**: Move beyond simple lists and single hierarchies
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain task relationships across different views
- **Scalability**: Handle complex project structures efficiently
- **Flexibility**: Adapt organization system as needs change

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Structure Innovation**: Multitree structure offers advantages over traditional task management
- **CLI Productivity**: Command-line tools can be more efficient than GUI alternatives
- **Flexible Organization**: Tasks rarely fit into single, simple categories
- **Tool Evolution**: Task management tools are evolving beyond simple todo lists

This approach to task management recognizes that real-world projects and tasks often have complex relationships that don't fit neatly into traditional linear or single-hierarchy systems. The multitree structure provides a more flexible foundation for organizing complex work.
