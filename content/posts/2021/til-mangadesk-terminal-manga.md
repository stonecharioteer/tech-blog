## MangaDesk - Terminal Manga Client

[GitHub - darylhjd/mangadesk](https://github.com/darylhjd/mangadesk) - Terminal
client for MangaDex 📖

MangaDesk is a command-line application that provides:

- Browse manga directly from the terminal
- Search MangaDex's extensive library
- Read manga chapters in terminal interface
- Bookmark and track reading progress
- Lightweight alternative to web browsing
- Perfect for terminal enthusiasts who want everything in the command line

This is a great example of bringing traditionally GUI-based experiences to the
terminal, making it accessible for users who prefer command-line workflows or
need to access content in environments where GUI applications aren't available.
