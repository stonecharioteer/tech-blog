## Data Processing Tools

### uq - Universal Serialized Data Reader
- [GitHub - solarkennedy/uq: Universal serialized data reader to JSON](https://github.com/solarkennedy/uq)
- Command-line tool that converts various serialized data formats to JSON
- Supports multiple input formats (YAML, TOML, XML, etc.)
- Useful for data pipeline processing and format conversion
- Simplifies working with heterogeneous data sources

## Programming Language Learning

### Java for Python Programmers
- [Java for Python Programmers — Java for Python Programmers](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/java4python/Java4Python/toctree.html)
- Educational resource for Python developers learning Java
- Compares concepts between the two languages
- Highlights similarities and differences in syntax and approach
- Useful for polyglot programming and expanding language skills

## Python Advanced Features

### contextlib and Context Managers
- [contextlib — Utilities for with-statement contexts — Python 3.9.1 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack)
- Advanced context management utilities beyond basic `with` statements
- `ExitStack` allows dynamic management of multiple context managers
- Enables complex resource management patterns
- Critical for building robust applications with proper cleanup

### ExitStack Use Cases
- Managing variable numbers of resources
- Conditional context manager activation
- Complex cleanup scenarios
- Building custom context managers that compose other context managers
- Exception handling in multi-resource scenarios
