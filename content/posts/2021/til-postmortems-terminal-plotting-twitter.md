## Engineering Learning Resources

### Post-Mortem Collection

- [GitHub - danluu/post-mortems](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems)
- Comprehensive collection of engineering post-mortems from various companies
- Learn from real-world failures and incident responses
- Valuable resource for understanding system reliability and failure modes

### Learning from Failures

- **Incident Analysis**: Detailed breakdowns of what went wrong and why
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Deep dives into underlying causes of failures
- **Prevention Strategies**: How teams prevent similar incidents
- **Cultural Insights**: How different organizations handle failures
- **Technical Patterns**: Common failure modes across different systems

### Notable Companies

- **Major Tech Companies**: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook outages
- **Financial Services**: Bank and trading system failures
- **Infrastructure Providers**: Cloud provider and CDN outages
- **Startups to Enterprises**: Lessons from organizations of all sizes

## Data Visualization Tools

### termplotlib - Terminal Plotting

- [GitHub - nschloe/termplotlib](https://github.com/nschloe/termplotlib)
- Python library for creating plots directly in the terminal
- Useful for quick data visualization in command-line environments
- ASCII-based plotting for servers and headless environments

### Terminal Plotting Benefits

- **No GUI Required**: Works in SSH sessions and headless environments
- **Quick Visualization**: Fast plotting for exploratory data analysis
- **Scriptable**: Easy integration into automation and monitoring scripts
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and resource usage

### Use Cases

- **Server Monitoring**: Plot metrics directly on servers
- **Data Analysis**: Quick plots during data exploration
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Visualize test results and metrics
- **Log Analysis**: Plot trends from log data

## Technical Community

### Technical Twitter Account

- [Happy Automata Twitter](https://twitter.com/happyautomata?s=08)
- Technical Twitter account sharing interesting content
- Curated technical content and discussions
- Part of the broader technical Twitter community

## Key Takeaways

- **Learning from Failures**: Post-mortems are invaluable for understanding
  system reliability
- **Visualization Accessibility**: Not all visualization needs complex GUI tools
- **Community Learning**: Technical communities share valuable insights and
  resources
- **Multiple Learning Channels**: Combine formal documentation with community
  resources
- **Practical Tools**: Simple tools often solve real-world problems effectively

These resources demonstrate different ways to learn and grow as an engineer -
from studying failures to creating quick visualizations to engaging with
technical communities.
