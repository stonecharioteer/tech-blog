## Networking and Security

### Innernet - Modern VPN Solution
- [Introducing 'innernet' | tonari blog](https://blog.tonari.no/introducing-innernet)
- WireGuard-based VPN solution designed for modern infrastructure
- Simplifies VPN management for teams and organizations
- Built with Rust for performance and security

### Innernet Features
- **WireGuard Foundation**: Built on top of modern, fast VPN protocol
- **Easy Management**: Simplified peer management and configuration
- **Scalable**: Designed for growing teams and infrastructure
- **Security First**: Modern cryptography and secure defaults
- **Cross-platform**: Works across different operating systems

### VPN Evolution
- **Traditional VPNs**: Often complex to set up and maintain
- **WireGuard**: Modern protocol with better performance and security
- **Management Layer**: Tools like Innernet add ease of use without sacrificing security
- **Infrastructure as Code**: VPN configuration that fits modern DevOps practices

## Productivity Tools

### NoteCalc - Note Taking with Calculations
- [NoteCalc - A handy note taking app with built in calculator](https://bbodi.github.io/notecalc3/)
- Note-taking application with integrated calculator functionality
- Combines text notes with mathematical calculations in one interface
- Useful for engineering, finance, and scientific work

### NoteCalc Capabilities
- **Inline Calculations**: Perform calculations directly within notes
- **Variable Support**: Define and reuse variables across calculations
- **Unit Conversions**: Built-in support for various units and conversions
