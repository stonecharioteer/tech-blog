## Networking and Security

### Innernet - Modern VPN Solution

- [Introducing 'innernet' | tonari blog](https://blog.tonari.no/introducing-innernet)
- WireGuard-based VPN solution designed for modern infrastructure
- Simplifies VPN management for teams and organizations
- Built with Rust for performance and security

### Innernet Features

- **WireGuard Foundation**: Built on top of modern, fast VPN protocol
- **Easy Management**: Simplified peer management and configuration
- **Scalable**: Designed for growing teams and infrastructure
- **Security First**: Modern cryptography and secure defaults
- **Cross-platform**: Works across different operating systems

### VPN Evolution

- **Traditional VPNs**: Often complex to set up and maintain
- **WireGuard**: Modern protocol with better performance and security
- **Management Layer**: Tools like Innernet add ease of use without sacrificing
  security
- **Infrastructure as Code**: VPN configuration that fits modern DevOps
  practices

## Productivity Tools

### NoteCalc - Note Taking with Calculations

- [NoteCalc - A handy note taking app with built in calculator](https://bbodi.github.io/notecalc3/)
- Note-taking application with integrated calculator functionality
- Combines text notes with mathematical calculations in one interface
- Useful for engineering, finance, and scientific work

### NoteCalc Capabilities

- **Inline Calculations**: Perform calculations directly within notes
- **Variable Support**: Define and reuse variables across calculations
- **Unit Conversions**: Built-in support for various units and conversions
- **Live Updates**: Calculations update automatically as values change

## Key Takeaways

- **VPN Modernization**: New tools are making VPN management simpler while
  maintaining security
- **Tool Integration**: Combining related functions (notes + calculations)
  improves workflow efficiency
- **Rust Ecosystem**: More infrastructure tools being built with Rust for
  performance and safety
- **User Experience**: Modern tools prioritize ease of use without compromising
  functionality

Both tools represent approaches to improving common workflows - Innernet makes
VPN management more accessible, while NoteCalc integrates two commonly used
functions into a single, more efficient tool.
