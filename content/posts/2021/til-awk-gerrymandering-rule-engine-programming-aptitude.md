## Command Line Tools and Text Processing

### AWK Programming Mastery
- [GitHub - FreedomBen/awk-hack-the-planet: Source code repo for Ben Porter (FreedomBen)'s talk at Linux Fest Northwest 2019 and 2020](https://github.com/FreedomBen/awk-hack-the-planet)
- Comprehensive AWK programming examples and techniques
- Conference talk materials from Linux Fest Northwest
- Advanced text processing and data manipulation with AWK
- Demonstrates AWK's power beyond simple field extraction

### AWK Advanced Techniques
- **Pattern Matching**: Complex regex patterns for data extraction
- **Data Transformation**: Converting between different data formats
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computing averages, sums, and distributions
- **Report Generation**: Creating formatted output and summaries

## Data Visualization and Political Science

### Gerrymandering Visualization
- [GitHub - mazore/gerrymandering: A program that draws district lines around a two-party grid of people (equal proportions for each party) in order to give an unfair advantage to one party.](https://github.com/mazore/gerrymandering)
- Interactive demonstration of electoral district manipulation
- Visualizes how district boundaries can affect election outcomes
- Educational tool for understanding political redistricting
- Algorithmic approach to a complex political and mathematical problem

### Electoral Mathematics
- **Geometric Algorithms**: Drawing district boundaries algorithmically
- **Statistical Bias**: Measuring the impact of different districting strategies
- **Visualization Techniques**: Making complex political concepts accessible
- **Educational Applications**: Teaching civic engagement through technology

## Business Logic and Rule Processing

### Python Rule Engine
- [GitHub - zeroSteiner/rule-engine: A lightweight, optionally typed expression language with a custom grammar for matching arbitrary Python objects.](https://github.com/zeroSteiner/rule-engine)
- Flexible rule engine for Python applications
- Custom expression language for complex business logic
- Type-safe rule evaluation with custom grammar
- Alternative to hardcoded conditional logic

### Rule Engine Applications
- **Business Logic**: Separating rules from application code
