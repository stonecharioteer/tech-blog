## Algorithm Learning and Practice

### Comprehensive Algorithm Solutions
- [GitHub - alqamahjsr/Algorithms: leetcode.com , algoexpert.io solutions in python and swift](https://github.com/alqamahjsr/Algorithms)
- Curated collection of algorithm solutions from LeetCode and AlgoExpert
- Implementations in Python and Swift programming languages
- Organized repository for systematic algorithm study and interview preparation
- Community-contributed solutions with multiple approaches

### Algorithm Study Benefits
- **Interview Preparation**: Systematic practice for technical interviews
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding common algorithmic patterns
- **Language Learning**: Comparing implementations across different languages

## Python Language Evolution

### Structural Pattern Matching (PEP 636)
- [PEP 636 -- Structural Pattern Matching: Tutorial | Python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/)
- Official tutorial for Python's new pattern matching feature
- Introduced in Python 3.10 as a major language enhancement
- Provides match/case statements similar to switch statements in other languages
- Enables sophisticated pattern-based control flow and data extraction

### Pattern Matching Capabilities
```python
# Basic pattern matching
match value:
    case 0:
        return "zero"
    case 1 | 2 | 3:
        return "small"
    case x if x > 10:
        return "large"
    case _:
        return "other"

# Data structure patterns
match data:
    case {"type": "user", "name": str(name)}:
        return f"User: {name}"
    case [first, *rest]:
        return f"List starting with {first}"
    case Point(x=0, y=0):
        return "Origin point"
```

### Pattern Matching Applications
- **Data Processing**: Elegant handling of complex data structures
- **State Machines**: Clean implementation of state-based logic
- **Parser Implementation**: Simplifying parsing and transformation logic
- **API Response Handling**: Structured processing of varied response formats

## Advanced Python Features

### Structural Pattern Benefits
