- [Flask by Example – Project Setup – Real Python](https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/)
- Comprehensive Flask tutorial series from Real Python
- Covers project structure, configuration, and best practices
- Step-by-step approach to building production-ready Flask applications
- Includes deployment considerations and modern development practices

### Redis with Python
- [How to Use Redis With Python – Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-redis/)
- Guide to integrating Redis with Python applications
- Covers caching, session storage, and data structures
- Performance optimization techniques for web applications
- Essential knowledge for scalable Python web development

### Redis Applications
- **Caching**: Improve application performance with fast data access
- **Session Storage**: Scalable session management for web applications
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous task processing and communication
- **Real-time Features**: Support for live updates and notifications

## System Administration Tools

### duf - Better Disk Usage Tool
- [GitHub - muesli/duf: Disk Usage/Free Utility - a better 'df' alternative](https://github.com/muesli/duf)
- Modern replacement for the traditional `df` command
- Colorized output with better formatting and readability
- Additional information like filesystem types and mount points
- Cross-platform support with consistent interface

### duf Features
