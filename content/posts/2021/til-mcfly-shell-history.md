## McFly - Intelligent Shell History

[GitHub - cantino/mcfly](https://github.com/cantino/mcfly) - Fly through your shell history. Great Scott!

McFly replaces your default shell history search (Ctrl+R) with a smarter alternative:

### Key Features:
- **Learning Algorithm**: Prioritizes commands based on frequency, recency, and context
- **Fuzzy Search**: Find commands even with typos or partial matches
- **Visual Interface**: Shows command context and selection clearly
- **Cross-Shell Support**: Works with bash, zsh, and fish
- **Fast Performance**: Written in Rust for speed
- **Directory Context**: Considers which directory commands were run in

### Why It's Better:
- Learns your workflow patterns over time
- Reduces time spent searching through history
- More intuitive than standard Ctrl+R search
- Great for developers who run many similar commands

This is particularly useful for developers who frequently run complex commands with multiple flags and need quick access to their command history.
