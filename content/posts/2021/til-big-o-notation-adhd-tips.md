## Computer Science Fundamentals

### Big-O Notation for Self-Taught Programmers
- [Big-O notation explained by a self-taught programmer](https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/big-o-notation-explained.html)
- Clear explanation of algorithmic complexity analysis
- Written from the perspective of a self-taught programmer
- Practical approach to understanding time and space complexity
- Bridges the gap between academic theory and practical programming

### Key Big-O Concepts
- **Time Complexity**: How algorithm performance scales with input size
- **Space Complexity**: How memory usage scales with input size
- **Common Complexities**: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(nÂ²), O(2^n)
- **Real-World Applications**: Understanding performance implications of algorithm choices

### Practical Algorithm Analysis
- **Performance Prediction**: Estimate how algorithms will perform at scale
- **Optimization Decisions**: Choose appropriate algorithms and data structures
- **Interview Preparation**: Essential concept for technical interviews
- **Code Review**: Evaluate code efficiency and scalability
