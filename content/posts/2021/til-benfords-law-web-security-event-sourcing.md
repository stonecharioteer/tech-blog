## Benford's Law - Statistical Fraud Detection

[Benford's law - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)

Fascinating mathematical principle used in fraud detection and data analysis:

### The Principle:
In many real-world datasets, the digit 1 appears as the first digit about 30.1% of the time, while 9 appears only 4.6% of the time. This follows a specific logarithmic distribution.

### Applications:
- **Fraud Detection**: Accounting fraud often violates Benford's Law
- **Election Auditing**: Detecting manipulated voting data
- **Scientific Data**: Validating experimental results
- **Financial Analysis**: Spotting suspicious financial reporting

### Why It Works:
Natural datasets often span multiple orders of magnitude, creating this counter-intuitive but mathematically predictable pattern.

## Web Security Headers Demystified

[CSRF, CORS, and HTTP Security headers Demystified](https://blog.vnaik.com/posts/web-attacks.html)

Comprehensive guide to understanding web security vulnerabilities and protections:

### Key Topics:
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: How attackers exploit user trust
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Managing cross-domain requests safely
- **Security Headers**: Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Attack Vectors**: Real-world examples and mitigation strategies

## Event Sourcing Pattern

[Event Sourcing pattern - Cloud Design Patterns | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)

Microsoft's comprehensive guide to Event Sourcing architecture:

### Core Concepts:
- **Immutable Events**: Store state changes as sequence of events
- **Event Store**: Append-only storage for all domain events
- **Projection**: Building current state from event history
- **Temporal Queries**: Query system state at any point in time

### Benefits:
- Complete audit trail
- Ability to replay events
- Support for complex business scenarios
- High performance and scalability

## Mozilla Web Security Guidelines

[Web Security](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security)

Mozilla's authoritative guide to web application security:

### Coverage:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Best practices for user management
- **Transport Security**: HTTPS, HSTS, certificate management
- **Content Security**: CSP, XSS prevention, input validation
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive header configuration
- **API Security**: RESTful API security considerations

Essential reference for any web developer serious about security.
