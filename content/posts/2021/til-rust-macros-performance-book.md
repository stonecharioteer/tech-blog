## The Little Book of Rust Macros

[Introduction - The Little Book of Rust Macros](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/introduction.html)

Comprehensive guide to understanding and writing Rust macros:

### What It Covers:
- **Macro Fundamentals**: How macros work in Rust's compilation process
- **Declarative Macros**: `macro_rules!` patterns and syntax
- **Procedural Macros**: Custom derive, attribute, and function-like macros
- **Advanced Patterns**: Complex macro techniques and best practices
- **Debugging**: Tools and techniques for debugging macro code

### Why Macros Matter in Rust:
- **Code Generation**: Eliminate boilerplate and repetitive code
- **Domain-Specific Languages**: Create custom syntax for specific use cases
- **Compile-Time Logic**: Perform complex operations at compile time
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Generate efficient code without runtime overhead

### Learning Path:
1. Start with simple `macro_rules!` examples
2. Understand pattern matching in macros
3. Progress to procedural macros
4. Learn debugging and testing techniques

## The Rust Performance Book

[Title Page - The Rust Performance Book](https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/title-page.html)

Authoritative guide to optimizing Rust code performance by Nicholas Nethercote:

### Key Topics:
- **Profiling**: Tools and techniques for measuring performance
- **Memory Management**: Optimizing allocations and memory usage
- **CPU Optimization**: Instruction-level optimizations
- **Compilation**: Compiler flags and optimization settings
- **Benchmarking**: Proper performance measurement techniques

### Performance Areas:
- **Hot Path Optimization**: Focus optimization efforts effectively
- **Data Structure Choice**: Selecting optimal data structures
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Complexity analysis and optimization
- **System-Level Concerns**: Cache efficiency, branch prediction

### Why This Book Is Valuable:
- Written by a Mozilla performance engineer
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Rust-specific optimization techniques
- Practical, actionable advice

Both resources are essential for Rust developers looking to write more sophisticated and efficient code.
