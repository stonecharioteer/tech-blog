## Coding Interviews and Algorithms

### Coding Interview Patterns
- [14 Patterns to Ace Any Coding Interview Question | Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed)
- Systematic approach to solving coding interview problems
- Identifies common patterns across different types of questions
- Helps recognize which pattern to apply to new problems
- More effective than memorizing individual solutions

### Curated LeetCode Problems
- [New Year Gift - Curated List of Top 75 LeetCode Questions to Save Your Time - Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)
- Community-curated list of essential LeetCode problems
- Covers most important patterns and concepts
- Time-efficient alternative to solving hundreds of problems randomly
- Focuses on high-value problems that appear frequently in interviews

## Developer Tools and Platforms

### Backstage - Developer Portal Platform
- [GitHub - backstage/backstage: Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)
- Open-source platform for building unified developer portals
- Created by Spotify and now a CNCF project
- Centralizes documentation, services, and tools for development teams
- Helps manage microservices complexity and improve developer experience

### Key Backstage Features
- **Service Catalog**: Centralized registry of all services and components
- **Software Templates**: Standardized project scaffolding
- **TechDocs**: Documentation-as-code integration
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible with custom plugins
- **API Management**: Central API discovery and documentation

## Privacy and Web Browsing

### Privacy-Focused Browsers
- [Web Browsers | PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/)
- Comprehensive guide to privacy-focused web browsers
- Compares different browsers' privacy features and settings
- Recommendations for enhanced privacy and security
- Part of broader privacy-focused tool recommendations

### Browser Privacy Considerations
- **Data Collection**: Understanding what browsers collect and share
- **Tracking Protection**: Built-in anti-tracking features
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Privacy-enhancing browser extensions
- **Configuration**: Privacy-focused browser settings and configurations

## Writing and Documentation

### Academic Writing Standards
- [APA Style 6th Edition Blog: Abbreviations](https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/abbreviations/)
- Guidelines for using abbreviations in academic writing
- Important for technical documentation and research papers
- Helps maintain consistency and clarity in professional writing
- Part of broader academic writing standards

## Terminal and Command Line

### Less Pager Color Configuration
- If you're setting `LESS` to a value, ensure that you use `-R` or colors in your terminal will be rendered in raw mode (their full escape sequence is printed) in any view that uses `less` as a pager, such as `git`
- Critical for maintaining colored output in Git and other tools
- Common configuration issue that breaks terminal color display
- Environment variable: `export LESS="-R"`

### Terminal Configuration Best Practices
- **Color Support**: Ensuring tools display colors correctly
- **Pager Configuration**: Optimizing less and other pagers
- **Git Integration**: Maintaining colored git output
- **Cross-tool Consistency**: Unified terminal experience

## Fun and Creative Tools

### Tengwar Transcriber
- [Tengwar Feanor Elvish Transcriber](https://tengwartranscriber.github.io)
- Web tool for transcribing text into Tolkien's Tengwar script
- Useful for fantasy writing, artistic projects, or Tolkien enthusiasts
- Demonstrates intersection of technology and creative/artistic interests
- Example of niche tools built for specific communities

## Key Takeaways

- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning patterns is more effective than memorizing individual solutions
- **Curated Learning**: High-quality, curated resources save time and improve learning outcomes
- **Developer Experience**: Tools like Backstage address real problems in modern software development
- **Privacy Awareness**: Understanding browser privacy implications is increasingly important
- **Terminal Configuration**: Proper environment variable setup is crucial for good terminal experience
- **Niche Tools**: Specialized tools serve specific communities and interests
- **Documentation Standards**: Professional writing requires understanding of style guidelines

These resources span from practical development tools to privacy considerations to creative applications, showing the breadth of valuable learning available online.
