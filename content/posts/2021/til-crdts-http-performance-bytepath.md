## CRDTs: The Hard Parts

[CRDTs: The Hard Parts - YouTube](https://youtu.be/x7drE24geUw)

An excellent talk about Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and the challenging aspects of implementing them in distributed systems. CRDTs allow multiple nodes to update shared data without coordination, automatically resolving conflicts.

## Extreme HTTP Performance Tuning

[Extreme HTTP Performance Tuning: 1.2M API req/s on a 4 vCPU EC2 Instance](https://talawah.io/blog/extreme-http-performance-tuning-one-point-two-million/)

Fascinating deep dive into achieving 1.2 million API requests per second on a single 4 vCPU EC2 instance. Covers:
- Network stack optimizations
- Application-level tuning
- System-level configuration
- Benchmarking methodologies
- Real-world performance considerations

## BYTEPATH - Arcade Shooter Game

[GitHub - a327ex/BYTEPATH](https://github.com/a327ex/BYTEPATH) - A replayable arcade shooter with a focus on build theorycrafting.

An interesting game development project that combines:
- Arcade shooter mechanics
- Build theorycrafting (like RPG character builds)
- Replayability through different strategies
- Clean game architecture and code organization

Great resource for learning game development patterns and Lua programming.
