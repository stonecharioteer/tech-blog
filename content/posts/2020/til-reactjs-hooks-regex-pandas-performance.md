## TIL 2020-09-03

1. **[ReactJS docs with hooks](https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/)** - Converting React class components to use hooks for better code organization.

2. **[Regex101](https://regex101.com/)** - Online regex tester and debugger with explanations.

3. **[Regexr](https://regexr.com/)** - Interactive regular expression tool for learning and testing.

4. **Pandas Performance Tip** - It's much faster to use Pandas' filters with the `&` and `|` operators than combining conditions with `zip`. Use intermediate dataframes and multiple `.loc` calls instead of `zip` with `any` or `all`.
