Today's discoveries span documentation, programming languages, productivity tools, and hardware development.

## Writing Manual Pages

[How to Write a Man Page](https://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/man_pages.html) provides comprehensive guidance on creating proper Unix manual pages. Man pages follow a specific structure with sections like NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, and EXAMPLES. Understanding this format is essential for creating professional command-line tools.

## Lessons from Haskell Open Source

The [BOB 2020 talk by Albert Krewinkel](https://youtu.be/JpNEIpLtCHs) shares insights from 14 years of maintaining Haskell open source projects. Key lessons include the importance of documentation, maintaining backward compatibility, and building sustainable contribution workflows. These principles apply beyond Haskell to any open source project.

## Orger - Data to Org-Mode Conversion

[Orger](https://github.com/karlicoss/orger) is a powerful tool for converting various data sources into searchable and interactive org-mode views. It can transform data from APIs, databases, and files into structured org-mode documents, making personal data analysis and knowledge management more effective.

## IoT Development Platforms

[Pitaya Go](https://github.com/makerdiary/pitaya-go) represents modern IoT development with multiprotocol wireless connectivity. The platform supports Bluetooth, Thread, and Zigbee protocols. Additionally, the [Python Keyboard](https://github.com/makerdiary/python-keyboard) project shows how Python can be used for hardware projects, creating hand-wired USB and Bluetooth keyboards.

## Additional Tools

- **Keybase**: Secure messaging and file sharing platform
- **FastAPI Tutorial**: Modern Python API development
- **Pandoc**: Universal document converter with powerful filtering capabilities
- **Minimal Bash Templates**: Safe scripting practices

These discoveries highlight the importance of proper documentation, the value of long-term open source maintenance, and the growing accessibility of IoT development through modern platforms and tools.
