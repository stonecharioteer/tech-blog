## Programming Language Development

### LLVM for Programming Language Creators

- [A Complete Guide to LLVM for Programming Language Creators](https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/llvm-ir-cpp-api-tutorial/)
- Comprehensive tutorial on using LLVM for language implementation
- Covers LLVM IR generation and C++ API usage
- Practical approach to compiler backend development

### LLVM Benefits for Language Development

- **Code Generation**: High-quality code generation for multiple architectures
- **Optimization**: Advanced optimization passes for performance
- **Target Independence**: Single IR compiles to many architectures
- **Ecosystem**: Rich tooling and community support

### Language Implementation Pipeline

- **Frontend**: Parse source code to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- **Middle-end**: Generate LLVM IR from AST
- **Backend**: LLVM optimizes and generates machine code
- **Runtime**: Link with runtime system and standard libraries

## System Monitoring and Operations

### Bash HTTP Monitoring Dashboard

- [Bash HTTP monitoring dashboard - Raymii.org](https://raymii.org/s/software/Bash_HTTP_Monitoring_Dashboard.html)
- Simple monitoring solution using only Bash scripts
- Demonstrates power of shell scripting for ops tasks
- Lightweight alternative to complex monitoring systems

### Monitoring Benefits

- **Simplicity**: No complex dependencies or installation
- **Customization**: Easy to modify for specific needs
- **Understanding**: Clear logic visible in shell scripts
- **Portability**: Runs anywhere Bash is available

### GitHub Dark Theme

- [GitHub - StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/Github-Dark)
- Dark theme for GitHub to reduce eye strain
- Browser extension for better development experience
- Customizable styling for personal preferences

## Learning and Professional Development

### Engineering Blogs Collection

- [GitHub - kilimchoi/engineering-blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs)
- Curated list of engineering blogs from companies and individuals
- Valuable resource for staying current with industry practices
- Insights into how different organizations solve technical problems

### Engineering Blog Benefits

- **Industry Insights**: Learn from real-world engineering challenges

## Academic and Technical Writing

### PhD Thesis in Markdown

- [GitHub - tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown](https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown)
- Template for writing academic theses using Markdown
- Alternative to LaTeX with more accessible syntax
- Demonstrates modern approaches to academic document preparation

### Markdown for Academic Writing

- **Simplicity**: Focus on content rather than formatting
- **Version Control**: Easy to track changes with Git
- **Portability**: Convert to multiple output formats
- **Collaboration**: Easier review and collaboration processes

### Academic Writing Workflow

- **Writing**: Focus on content in plain text
- **References**: Integrate with reference managers
- **Formatting**: Automated formatting for different requirements
- **Publication**: Generate PDFs, HTML, or other required formats

## Personal and Technical Insights

### Experimenting with Hearing Loss

- [Experimenting On My Hearing Loss](https://0x90.psaux.io/2020/12/19/Experimenting-On-My-Hearing-Loss/)
- Personal exploration of accessibility and technology
- Data-driven approach to understanding personal challenges
- Demonstrates intersection of personal experience and technical analysis

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Personal Impact**: How technical choices affect individuals with
  disabilities
- **Data Analysis**: Using technical skills to understand personal challenges
- **Awareness**: Building empathy through personal experience
- **Design Impact**: How personal insights can improve product design

## Key Takeaways
