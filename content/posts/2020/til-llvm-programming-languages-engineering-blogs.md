## Programming Language Development

### LLVM for Programming Language Creators
- [A Complete Guide to LLVM for Programming Language Creators](https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/llvm-ir-cpp-api-tutorial/)
- Comprehensive tutorial on using LLVM for language implementation
- Covers LLVM IR generation and C++ API usage
- Practical approach to compiler backend development

### LLVM Benefits for Language Development
- **Code Generation**: High-quality code generation for multiple architectures
- **Optimization**: Advanced optimization passes for performance
- **Target Independence**: Single IR compiles to many architectures
- **Ecosystem**: Rich tooling and community support

### Language Implementation Pipeline
- **Frontend**: Parse source code to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- **Middle-end**: Generate LLVM IR from AST
- **Backend**: LLVM optimizes and generates machine code
- **Runtime**: Link with runtime system and standard libraries

## System Monitoring and Operations

### Bash HTTP Monitoring Dashboard
- [Bash HTTP monitoring dashboard - Raymii.org](https://raymii.org/s/software/Bash_HTTP_Monitoring_Dashboard.html)
- Simple monitoring solution using only Bash scripts
- Demonstrates power of shell scripting for ops tasks
- Lightweight alternative to complex monitoring systems

### Monitoring Benefits
- **Simplicity**: No complex dependencies or installation
- **Customization**: Easy to modify for specific needs
- **Understanding**: Clear logic visible in shell scripts
- **Portability**: Runs anywhere Bash is available

### GitHub Dark Theme
- [GitHub - StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/Github-Dark)
- Dark theme for GitHub to reduce eye strain
- Browser extension for better development experience
- Customizable styling for personal preferences

## Academic and Technical Writing

### PhD Thesis in Markdown
- [GitHub - tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown](https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown)
- Template for writing academic theses using Markdown
- Alternative to LaTeX with more accessible syntax
- Demonstrates modern approaches to academic document preparation

### Markdown for Academic Writing
- **Simplicity**: Focus on content rather than formatting
- **Version Control**: Easy to track changes with Git
- **Portability**: Convert to multiple output formats
- **Collaboration**: Easier review and collaboration processes

### Academic Writing Workflow
- **Writing**: Focus on content in plain text
- **References**: Integrate with reference managers
- **Formatting**: Automated formatting for different requirements
- **Publication**: Generate PDFs, HTML, or other required formats

## Personal and Technical Insights
