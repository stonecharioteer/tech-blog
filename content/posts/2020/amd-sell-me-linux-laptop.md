I want to buy an AMD Laptop that runs Linux. No one wants to sell me one.

## Preamble

I am a Linux user. I grew up with a Windows 98->ME->2000 PC with an Intel Pentium 4 Processor and one day, I hit the *Wall of XP*. XP would not run. I bought a DDR1 1GB Stick. Do you know how hard that was to find in India? Then, XP ran, in *classic mode*.

Eventually, I found Linux Mint 7: Gloria. It was, *forgive the pun*, **glorious**. I could do everything. Write that fantasy fiction book I told myself I'd sell one day, learn how to use GIMP to make [signatures](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Forum-Signature) for [the PHP BBforums](https://www.phpbb.com/) that were all the rage in the latter half of the 00's, and then eventually teach myself Python to build a career.

I do so much in Linux these days that using a Windows computer whenever I need to play a game is so painful. I keep forgetting that there is no *usable* shell. **Don't point your Cygwins and MINGWs at me**. I keep forgetting I have to install things through weird installers. Chocolatey exists, but I am not in Windows long enough to appreciate it, and the lack of text-based configuration makes me groan. Environment variables in dialog boxes? With character limits?

So I want a laptop that will run Linux.

But I also want power. I don't want something half-baked. I can finally afford to buy something good, and when I look, I see... **nothing**.

Sheer, *exasperating*, **nothing**.

I want a *great* laptop that runs Linux.

And now, here's the other part. **I do not want Intel on my hardware.**

To make matters **harder for myself**: **I *refuse* to pay NVIDIA any more money**.

I am not going to bother talking about those choices, since opinion-piece make no sense, but I want to talk only about **how hard it is to find a pure AMD machine**, and **how much harder** it is to find an AMD machine that runs Linux.

## Asus

I love the innovation Asus is doing with its laptops. I *love* the idea of the Zenbook Pro Duos and the Zephyrus Pro Duos. However, both of them are Intel and NVIDIA only. Dual screens! On a laptop! That would add to my productivity so hard because I could have a terminal open in the bottom screen at all times.

My options are limited, I agree, but let's look at the laptop options I do have.
