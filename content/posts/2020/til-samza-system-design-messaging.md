## Stream Processing and Big Data

### Apache Samza
- [Apache Samza](https://samza.apache.org/)
- Distributed stream processing framework
- Built for handling real-time data streams at scale
- Integrates closely with Apache Kafka for message streaming
- Used by LinkedIn and other large-scale organizations
- Provides fault-tolerant, scalable stream processing capabilities

## System Design Resources

### System Design Learning
- [Awesome System Design](https://github.com/madd86/awesome-system-design)
- Curated collection of system design resources
- Covers distributed systems, scalability, and architecture patterns
- Essential for technical interviews and building large-scale systems
- Includes case studies, papers, and practical examples

## Messaging and Monitoring Tools

### Origin - Monitoring and Alert Server
- [`origin` is a monitoring and alert server based on `ZeroMQ` and `JSON` messaging](https://git.sr.ht/~chiefnoah/origin/tree/master/README.md)
- Lightweight monitoring solution using ZeroMQ for message transport
- JSON-based configuration and messaging
- Suitable for custom monitoring setups
- Demonstrates practical use of ZeroMQ in production systems

### Plumber - Multi-Protocol Messaging CLI
- [`plumber` is a CLI for Kafka, RabbitMQ and other messaging systems](https://github.com/batchcorp/plumber)
- Unified command-line interface for multiple messaging platforms
- Supports Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other popular message brokers
- Useful for debugging, testing, and interacting with messaging infrastructure
- Simplifies working with heterogeneous messaging environments

## Key Takeaways

### Stream Processing Ecosystem
- Apache Samza represents mature stream processing technology
- Critical for real-time data processing at scale
- Part of broader Apache ecosystem (Kafka, Storm, Flink)

### Tooling and Operations
- Specialized tools like Plumber improve developer productivity
- Monitoring systems like Origin show lightweight approaches to observability
- System design knowledge is fundamental for building scalable applications
