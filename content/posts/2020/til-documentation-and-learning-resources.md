Today I explored my archive and discovered excellent resources on documentation systems, educational content, and structured learning approaches that every developer should know about.

## The Four-Part Documentation System

### Divio's Documentation Framework

[Divio's Documentation System](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/) presents a revolutionary approach to organizing technical documentation into four distinct types:

{{< note title="The Four Types of Documentation" >}}
1. **Tutorials** - Learning-oriented, hands-on lessons
2. **How-to Guides** - Problem-oriented, step-by-step solutions  
3. **Reference** - Information-oriented, systematic descriptions
4. **Explanation** - Understanding-oriented, theoretical knowledge
{{< /note >}}

This framework was beautifully explained in the video **[What Nobody Tells You about Documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg)** - one of the greatest presentations on documentation structure I've encountered.

### Why This Framework Works

Each documentation type serves a different user need:

```
                Learning        Working
    Study   |  Tutorials   |  How-to Guides  |
            |              |                 |
    Work    | Explanation  |   Reference     |
```

**Tutorials** guide newcomers through their first successful experience with your product. **How-to guides** solve specific real-world problems for experienced users. **Reference** materials provide systematic, complete information. **Explanations** clarify concepts and design decisions.

{{< example title="Documentation Type Examples" >}}
- **Tutorial**: "Build your first Django app"
- **How-to**: "How to deploy Django with Docker"  
- **Reference**: "Django settings configuration"
- **Explanation**: "Why Django uses MVT architecture"
{{< /example >}}

### Google Season of Docs

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) is a program designed to improve open source documentation by connecting technical writers with open source communities. It's similar to Google Summer of Code but focuses specifically on documentation projects.

## Advanced Sphinx Documentation

### Sphinx Tabs Extension

[`sphinx-tabs`](https://github.com/djungelorm/sphinx-tabs) enables tabbed content in Sphinx documentation:

```rst
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Python

      .. code-block:: python

         def hello():
             print("Hello from Python!")

   .. tab:: JavaScript

      .. code-block:: javascript

         function hello() {
             console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
         }
```

This creates clean, organized documentation where users can switch between different implementations or languages.

### Modern Documentation Themes

[MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) provides a beautiful Material Design theme for MkDocs documentation:

- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- **Search Integration**: Fast client-side search
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme switching

```rust
// Declarative macros
macro_rules! say_hello {
    () => {
        println!("Hello!");
    };
}

// Procedural macros for more complex transformations
```

### Ruby Object-Oriented Design

**[Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby - Sandi Metz](https://www.poodr.com/)** is considered the definitive guide to OOP principles in Ruby. Metz explains complex concepts like:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency injection
