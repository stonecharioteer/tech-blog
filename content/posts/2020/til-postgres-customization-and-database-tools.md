Today I discovered comprehensive techniques for customizing PostgreSQL environments and learned advanced database management practices that significantly improve developer and DBA productivity.

## PostgreSQL Shell Customization with .psqlrc

### Advanced .psqlrc Configuration

[Customizing PostgreSQL shell using psqlrc](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/07/16/customizing-my-postgres-shell-using-psqlrc/) reveals powerful techniques for creating a more productive database environment:

```sql
-- ~/.psqlrc - PostgreSQL shell customization

-- Set better default formatting
\set QUIET 1
\pset null '[NULL]'
\pset linestyle unicode
\pset border 2
\pset format wrapped
\set COMP_KEYWORD_CASE upper
\set HISTSIZE 10000
\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1m%]%M %n@%/%R%[%033[0m%]%# '
\set PROMPT2 '[more] %R > '
\unset QUIET

-- Timing for performance monitoring
\timing

-- Show expanded output for wide tables
\x auto

-- Better error handling
\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK interactive
\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- Helpful shortcuts and aliases
\set version 'SELECT version();'
\set extensions 'SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions ORDER BY name;'
\set settings 'SELECT name, setting, unit, context FROM pg_settings ORDER BY name;'
\set locks 'SELECT * FROM pg_locks ORDER BY pid;'
\set activity 'SELECT pid, usename, application_name, client_addr, state, query_start, query FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start DESC;'
\set blocking 'SELECT blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid, blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user, blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid, blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user, blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement, blocking_activity.query AS current_statement_in_blocking_process FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid WHERE NOT blocked_locks.GRANTED;'

-- Database size information
\set dbsize 'SELECT datname, pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) as size FROM pg_database ORDER BY pg_database_size(datname) DESC;'
\set tablesize 'SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||''.''||tablename)) as size FROM pg_tables ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||''.''||tablename) DESC;'

-- Index usage statistics
\set indexusage 'SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation FROM pg_stats WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;'
\set indexsize 'SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as size FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) DESC;'

-- Connection information
\set conninfo 'SELECT usename, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY usename ORDER BY count DESC;'

-- Slow queries (requires pg_stat_statements)
\set slowqueries 'SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;'

-- Replication status
\set replication 'SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;'

-- Vacuum and analyze status
\set vacuum_stats 'SELECT schemaname, tablename, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze FROM pg_stat_user_tables ORDER BY last_vacuum DESC NULLS LAST;'
```

### Interactive PostgreSQL Development

Enhanced psql environment for database development:

```sql
-- Development-specific shortcuts in .psqlrc

-- Quick table inspection
\set desc '\\d+'
\set tables '\\dt'
\set sequences '\\ds'
\set views '\\dv'
\set functions '\\df'
\set schemas '\\dn'

-- Development queries
\set missing_indexes 'SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation FROM pg_stats WHERE schemaname = ''public'' AND n_distinct > 100 AND correlation < 0.1;'

\set duplicate_indexes 'SELECT pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_relation_size(idx))::BIGINT) AS SIZE, (array_agg(indexrelname))[1] AS idx1, (array_agg(indexrelname))[2] AS idx2, (array_agg(indexrelname))[3] AS idx3, (array_agg(indexrelname))[4] AS idx4 FROM (SELECT indexrelname, regexp_split_to_array(indexdef, E''\\\('') AS parts FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = ''public'') t GROUP BY parts[2] HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;'

-- Performance monitoring
\set cache_hit_ratio 'SELECT ''index hit rate'' as name, (sum(idx_blks_hit)) / sum(idx_blks_hit + idx_blks_read) as ratio FROM pg_statio_user_indexes union all SELECT ''cache hit rate'' as name, sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio FROM pg_statio_user_tables;'

-- Transaction and connection monitoring
\set long_running_queries 'SELECT pid, usename, datname, query_start, now() - query_start AS duration, state, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE (now() - query_start) > interval ''5 minutes'' AND state != ''idle'' ORDER BY duration DESC;'

-- Security and permissions
\set user_permissions 'SELECT grantee, privilege_type, table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.role_table_grants WHERE grantee = current_user;'
```

## Advanced Database Monitoring and Management

### Database Performance Analysis

```sql
-- Comprehensive database health check queries

-- 1. Database size and growth trends
WITH db_size AS (
    SELECT 
        datname,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) as current_size,
        pg_database_size(datname) as size_bytes
    FROM pg_database 
    WHERE datistemplate = false
)
SELECT * FROM db_size ORDER BY size_bytes DESC;

-- 2. Table bloat analysis
WITH table_bloat AS (
    SELECT
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as table_size,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as data_size,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) - 
                      pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as index_size,
        ROUND(
            100.0 * (pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) - 
                    pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) / 
                    NULLIF(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename), 0), 2
        ) as index_ratio
    FROM pg_tables 
    WHERE schemaname = 'public'
)
SELECT * FROM table_bloat 
ORDER BY pg_size_bytes(regexp_replace(table_size, '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::bigint) DESC;

-- 3. Index usage effectiveness
WITH index_usage AS (
    SELECT
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        indexname,
        idx_tup_read,
        idx_tup_fetch,
        CASE 
            WHEN idx_tup_read = 0 THEN 0
            ELSE ROUND(100.0 * idx_tup_fetch / idx_tup_read, 2)
        END as hit_rate,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as index_size
    FROM pg_stat_user_indexes psi
    JOIN pg_indexes pi ON psi.indexrelname = pi.indexname
    WHERE schemaname = 'public'
)
SELECT * FROM index_usage 
WHERE idx_tup_read > 0 
ORDER BY hit_rate ASC, idx_tup_read DESC;

-- 4. Query performance analysis (requires pg_stat_statements)
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    max_time,
    stddev_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / NULLIF(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent,
    pg_size_pretty(temp_blks_written * 8192::bigint) as temp_written
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE calls > 100  -- Focus on frequently called queries
ORDER BY total_time DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### Automated Maintenance Procedures

```sql
-- Database maintenance automation

-- 1. Comprehensive vacuum and analyze
DO $$
DECLARE
    table_record RECORD;
    vacuum_cmd TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Loop through all user tables
    FOR table_record IN 
        SELECT schemaname, tablename 
        FROM pg_tables 
        WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        -- Build vacuum analyze command
        vacuum_cmd := 'VACUUM ANALYZE ' || 
                     quote_ident(table_record.schemaname) || '.' || 
                     quote_ident(table_record.tablename);
        
        RAISE NOTICE 'Executing: %', vacuum_cmd;
        EXECUTE vacuum_cmd;
        
        -- Add delay to prevent overwhelming the system
        PERFORM pg_sleep(0.1);
    END LOOP;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Vacuum analyze completed for all tables';
END
$$;

-- 2. Index maintenance and optimization
WITH unused_indexes AS (
    SELECT 
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        indexname,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as size,
        idx_scan
    FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
    WHERE idx_scan = 0 
    AND schemaname = 'public'
    AND pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) > 1024 * 1024  -- Larger than 1MB
)
SELECT 
    'DROP INDEX ' || quote_ident(schemaname) || '.' || quote_ident(indexname) || ';' as drop_command,
    size,
    'Unused index on ' || tablename as reason
FROM unused_indexes
ORDER BY pg_size_bytes(size) DESC;

-- 3. Connection monitoring and cleanup
WITH connection_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        datname,
        usename,
        application_name,
        client_addr,
        state,
        COUNT(*) as connection_count,
        MAX(query_start) as last_query,
        SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'idle' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as idle_connections,
        SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as active_connections
    FROM pg_stat_activity 
    WHERE pid != pg_backend_pid()  -- Exclude current connection
    GROUP BY datname, usename, application_name, client_addr, state
)
SELECT 
    *,
    CASE 
        WHEN idle_connections > 10 AND last_query < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
        THEN 'Consider terminating idle connections'
        WHEN active_connections > 50
        THEN 'High active connection count - investigate'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as recommendation
FROM connection_stats
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;
```

## Database Security and Best Practices

### User Management and Security

```sql
-- PostgreSQL security configuration

-- 1. User and role management
-- Create application-specific roles
CREATE ROLE app_reader;
CREATE ROLE app_writer;
CREATE ROLE app_admin;

-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE myapp TO app_reader, app_writer, app_admin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_reader, app_writer, app_admin;

-- Reader permissions
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_reader;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app_reader;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO app_reader;

-- Writer permissions (includes reader)
GRANT app_reader TO app_writer;
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_writer;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app_writer;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO app_writer;

-- Admin permissions (includes writer)
GRANT app_writer TO app_admin;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO app_admin;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO app_admin;

-- 2. Create specific users
CREATE USER app_read_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password_here';
CREATE USER app_write_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password_here';
CREATE USER app_admin_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password_here';

-- Assign roles
GRANT app_reader TO app_read_user;
GRANT app_writer TO app_write_user;
GRANT app_admin TO app_admin_user;

-- 3. Security audit queries
\set security_audit 'SELECT usename, passwd, valuntil, usesuper, usecreatedb, usebypassrls FROM pg_user ORDER BY usename;'
\set role_memberships 'SELECT r.rolname, m.rolname as member FROM pg_roles r JOIN pg_auth_members am ON r.oid = am.roleid JOIN pg_roles m ON am.member = m.oid ORDER BY r.rolname;'
\set table_permissions 'SELECT grantee, table_schema, table_name, privilege_type FROM information_schema.role_table_grants WHERE table_schema = ''public'' ORDER BY grantee, table_name;'
```

### Backup and Recovery Procedures

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Advanced PostgreSQL backup script

DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_PORT="5432"
DB_NAME="myapp"
DB_USER="postgres"
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/postgresql"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "${BACKUP_DIR}"

# Full database backup with compression
echo "Starting full database backup..."
pg_dump -h "${DB_HOST}" -p "${DB_PORT}" -U "${DB_USER}" -d "${DB_NAME}" \
    --verbose --clean --create --format=custom \
    --file="${BACKUP_DIR}/full_backup_${DATE}.dump"

# Schema-only backup for quick structure reference
echo "Creating schema-only backup..."
pg_dump -h "${DB_HOST}" -p "${DB_PORT}" -U "${DB_USER}" -d "${DB_NAME}" \
    --schema-only --verbose \
    --file="${BACKUP_DIR}/schema_backup_${DATE}.sql"

# Data-only backup for large tables (if needed)
echo "Creating data-only backup..."
pg_dump -h "${DB_HOST}" -p "${DB_PORT}" -U "${DB_USER}" -d "${DB_NAME}" \
    --data-only --verbose --format=custom \
    --file="${BACKUP_DIR}/data_backup_${DATE}.dump"

# Table-specific backups for critical tables
CRITICAL_TABLES=("users" "orders" "products")
for table in "${CRITICAL_TABLES[@]}"; do
    echo "Backing up critical table: ${table}"
    pg_dump -h "${DB_HOST}" -p "${DB_PORT}" -U "${DB_USER}" -d "${DB_NAME}" \
        --table="${table}" --verbose --format=custom \
        --file="${BACKUP_DIR}/table_${table}_${DATE}.dump"
done

# Cleanup old backups
echo "Cleaning up backups older than ${RETENTION_DAYS} days..."
find "${BACKUP_DIR}" -type f -name "*.dump" -mtime +${RETENTION_DAYS} -delete
find "${BACKUP_DIR}" -type f -name "*.sql" -mtime +${RETENTION_DAYS} -delete

# Verify backup integrity
echo "Verifying backup integrity..."
pg_restore --list "${BACKUP_DIR}/full_backup_${DATE}.dump" > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup verification successful"
    
    # Log backup completion
    echo "$(date): Backup completed successfully - ${BACKUP_DIR}/full_backup_${DATE}.dump" >> "${BACKUP_DIR}/backup.log"
else
    echo "Backup verification failed!"
    echo "$(date): Backup verification failed - ${BACKUP_DIR}/full_backup_${DATE}.dump" >> "${BACKUP_DIR}/backup.log"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Backup process completed"
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Query Optimization

```sql
-- Query optimization and performance tuning

-- 1. Identify slow queries with detailed analysis
WITH slow_queries AS (
    SELECT 
        query,
        calls,
        total_time,
        mean_time,
        max_time,
        stddev_time,
        rows,
        100.0 * shared_blks_hit / NULLIF(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS cache_hit_ratio,
        shared_blks_read,
        shared_blks_written,
        temp_blks_read,
        temp_blks_written
    FROM pg_stat_statements 
    WHERE mean_time > 100  -- Queries averaging more than 100ms
    OR total_time > 10000  -- Queries with high total time
    ORDER BY total_time DESC
)
SELECT 
    LEFT(query, 100) as query_snippet,
    calls,
    ROUND(total_time::numeric, 2) as total_time_ms,
    ROUND(mean_time::numeric, 2) as mean_time_ms,
    ROUND(max_time::numeric, 2) as max_time_ms,
    rows,
    ROUND(cache_hit_ratio::numeric, 2) as cache_hit_pct,
    CASE 
        WHEN temp_blks_written > 0 THEN 'Uses temp files'
        WHEN cache_hit_ratio < 95 THEN 'Poor cache utilization'
        WHEN mean_time > 1000 THEN 'Very slow average'
        ELSE 'Review for optimization'
    END as optimization_hint
FROM slow_queries
LIMIT 20;

-- 2. Index recommendations based on query patterns
WITH table_scans AS (
    SELECT 
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        seq_scan,
        seq_tup_read,
        idx_scan,
        idx_tup_fetch,
        n_tup_ins + n_tup_upd + n_tup_del as modifications
    FROM pg_stat_user_tables
    WHERE schemaname = 'public'
),
index_candidates AS (
    SELECT 
        schemaname,
        tablename,
        seq_scan,
        seq_tup_read,
        CASE 
            WHEN seq_scan > 0 THEN seq_tup_read / seq_scan 
            ELSE 0 
        END as avg_seq_read,
        idx_scan,
        modifications,
        CASE 
            WHEN seq_scan > idx_scan AND seq_tup_read > 10000 
            THEN 'High sequential scan activity - consider indexing'
            WHEN modifications > (idx_scan + seq_scan) * 10 
            THEN 'High modification rate - index overhead may be significant'
            ELSE 'Normal access pattern'
        END as recommendation
    FROM table_scans
)
SELECT * FROM index_candidates 
WHERE recommendation LIKE 'High%'
ORDER BY avg_seq_read DESC;

-- 3. Connection and lock analysis
WITH connection_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        datname,
        usename,
        application_name,
        state,
        COUNT(*) as connection_count,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - query_start))) as avg_query_duration,
        MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - query_start))) as max_query_duration,
        SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'idle in transaction' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as idle_in_transaction
    FROM pg_stat_activity 
    WHERE pid != pg_backend_pid()
    GROUP BY datname, usename, application_name, state
)
SELECT 
    *,
    CASE 
        WHEN idle_in_transaction > 0 THEN 'Idle transactions detected - may cause blocking'
        WHEN max_query_duration > 300 THEN 'Long-running queries detected'
        WHEN connection_count > 100 THEN 'High connection count'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as alert
FROM connection_analysis
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;
```
