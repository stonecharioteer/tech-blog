## Python Exception Handling

### Python's Raise Statement with From Clause
- [Python's `raise` statement has a `from` clause, to preserve full tracebacks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24752395/python-raise-from-usage)
- [The Python `raise` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)
- Critical for maintaining debugging information when re-raising exceptions
- Preserves the original exception context and traceback chain

## Exception Chaining Syntax

### Basic Exception Chaining
```python
try:
    # Some operation that might fail
    risky_operation()
except SomeException as e:
    # Re-raise with context preserved
    raise NewException("Custom message") from e
```

### Benefits of Exception Chaining
- **Full Traceback Preservation**: Maintains complete error history
- **Better Debugging**: Shows both original and current exception contexts
- **Clear Error Propagation**: Makes it obvious how errors propagated through code
- **Professional Error Handling**: Industry best practice for exception management

## Exception Handling Best Practices

### When to Use Exception Chaining
- Converting between exception types (e.g., library exceptions to domain exceptions)
- Adding context to low-level errors
- Creating more meaningful error messages for users
- Maintaining debugging information in complex call stacks

### Exception Suppression
```python
# Suppress original exception (use sparingly)
raise NewException("Message") from None
```

### Debugging Benefits
- Helps identify root cause of complex errors
- Provides complete context for error investigation
- Essential for production debugging and error monitoring
- Improves error reporting and logging quality
