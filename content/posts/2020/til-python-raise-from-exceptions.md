## TIL 2020-08-06

1. **[Python's `raise` statement has a `from` clause](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24752395/python-raise-from-usage)** - This preserves full tracebacks when re-raising exceptions, providing better debugging information.

2. **[The Python `raise` statement documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)** - Official documentation covering all forms of the raise statement including exception chaining.
