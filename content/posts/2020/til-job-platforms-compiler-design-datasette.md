Today's discoveries span career development, compiler theory, data analysis
tools, and engineering management.

## Startup Job Platforms

Several specialized platforms focus on startup and tech opportunities:

### [JobFluent](https://www.jobfluent.com/)

Aggregates startup jobs across European tech hubs, providing centralized access
to opportunities in Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and other major tech cities.

### [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io/)

Curated remote jobs in programming, design, sales, and other tech disciplines.
Particularly valuable for location-independent opportunities.

### [Y Combinator's Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/)

Direct access to positions at YC portfolio companies, offering unique
opportunities at early-stage startups with strong backing.

## Compiler Construction Resources

### Academic Courses:

- [CS 4410/6410: Compiler Design (Northeastern)](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410/)
- [CSE 131: Compiler Construction (UCSD)](https://ucsd-cse131-f19.github.io/)

### Comprehensive Guides:

- [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) - Deep dive
  into shell scripting
- [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) - Practical
  interpreter implementation
- [Shell Command Language Specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18)

### Tools:

- [GNU Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) - Parser generator for LALR
  grammars

## Data Exploration with Datasette

[Datasette](https://datasette.io/) is an open-source multi-tool for exploring
and publishing data:

### Key Features:

- **Instant API**: Automatically generates JSON APIs from SQLite databases
- **Web Interface**: Browse data with filtering, sorting, and search
- **Publishing**: Deploy read-only databases with custom templates
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with authentication, visualization,
  and data import

### Use Cases:

- **Data Journalism**: Publish datasets with interactive exploration
- **API Prototyping**: Quickly create read-only APIs from CSV data
- **Data Documentation**: Self-documenting datasets with metadata
- **Analytics**: Lightweight alternative to complex BI tools

## Developer Productivity Measurement

[Stack Overflow's article on measuring developer productivity](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/07/measuring-developer-productivity/)
addresses the challenges of quantifying engineering work:

### Problems with Simple Metrics:

- **Lines of code**: Encourages verbose, inefficient code
- **Commits**: Can be gamed and doesn't reflect impact
- **Story points**: Subjective and team-dependent
- **Time tracking**: Doesn't account for thinking and problem-solving

### Better Approaches:

- **Outcome-focused metrics**: Feature delivery, bug reduction, user
  satisfaction
- **Flow metrics**: Cycle time, lead time, deployment frequency
- **Quality indicators**: Code review feedback, post-deployment issues
- **Team health**: Retention, satisfaction, knowledge sharing
