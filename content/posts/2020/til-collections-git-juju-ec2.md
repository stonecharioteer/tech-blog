## Python Programming

### Collections Module - defaultdict
- `collections.defaultdict` takes a *type* not a value
- It will initialize based on the default value for that type
- Common mistake: passing a value instead of a callable type
- Example: `defaultdict(list)` not `defaultdict([])`
- Cleaner than manually checking if keys exist before accessing

## Version Control

### Git Commands and Tricks
- `git log --format="%H" -n 1 | cat` outputs the last commit ID
- Useful for scripting and automation
- The `cat` ensures the output is properly formatted
- `%H` format specifier gives the full commit hash
- `-n 1` limits to the most recent commit

## Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps

### AWS EC2 Free Tier
- EC2 has a Free tier! I can request a bunch of machines here
- Great for learning and experimenting with cloud infrastructure
- Limited resources but sufficient for development and testing
- Good entry point for understanding cloud computing concepts

### Juju - Multi-Cloud Orchestration
- Juju is a tool that helps manage server providers, whether they are GCP, AWS, your own servers or Azure, among others
- Gives you one way to start, setup and run your servers across different cloud providers
- Abstracts away cloud provider differences
- Enables consistent deployment across hybrid and multi-cloud environments

#### Juju Configuration System
- Juju's configurations are called charms
- These are written in Python
- Charms define how services should be deployed and configured
- Reusable deployment patterns for common software stacks
- Community-maintained charm store with pre-built configurations
