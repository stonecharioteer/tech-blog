## TIL 2020-07-23

1. **[Memoizing Dash Callback Responses with Flask-Caching](http://dash.plotly.com/testing)** - It's possible to cache dash callback responses for better performance using flask-caching.

2. **Configurable Dash Registration** - Always ensure that dash registration in a Flask-Dash app is configurable. You might want to skip loading dash when testing backend-only functionality.

3. **pytest-dash Status** - pytest-dash has been abandoned since the official dash repository now supports Selenium testing via pytest directly.
