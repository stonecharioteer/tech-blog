I finally spoke at PyCon India! It was a great experience and a significant milestone in my career. I was a bit nervous speaking as someone who had just lost hearing in one ear, but I am glad that the organizers had arranged the "silent conference" system. The headphones supported mono-channels, which is a blessing for someone who is single-sided deaf, like me.

This was my first major speaking experience after becoming single-sided deaf. The conference's accessibility features, particularly the mono-channel headphone support, made a huge difference in my ability to participate fully as both a speaker and attendee.

## The Talk: MicroPython Adventures

My talk focused on MicroPython and hardware hacking, covering practical applications of Python in embedded systems. I demonstrated various projects and discussed how Python's simplicity makes hardware programming accessible to a broader audience.

{{< example title="Talk Highlights" >}}
- Introduction to MicroPython ecosystem
- Hardware project demonstrations
- Practical applications in IoT and automation
- Getting started with embedded Python development
- The "Shelfie" project - a smart bookshelf system

## Conference Experience

PyCon India 2019 was an incredible experience. The community was welcoming, the technical content was top-notch, and the organization was excellent. Speaking at such a prestigious conference was both nerve-wracking and exhilarating.

### Technical Setup

The conference's "silent conference" system was innovative:
- Individual headphones for each attendee
- Mono-channel support for accessibility
- Clear audio delivery without room acoustics issues
- Reduced ambient noise and distractions

This setup was particularly beneficial for speakers and attendees with hearing challenges.

## The Shelfie Project

One of the main projects I discussed was "Shelfie" - a smart bookshelf management system built with MicroPython. The project demonstrated:

- **Hardware Integration**: Sensors, displays, and network connectivity
- **Python Simplicity**: Complex hardware tasks made simple with Python
- **Real-world Applications**: Practical home automation solutions
- **Community Learning**: How to get started with hardware hacking

{{< tip title="Hardware + Python = Magic" >}}
MicroPython proves that you don't need to be a hardware engineer to build amazing embedded projects. Python's syntax and ecosystem make hardware programming accessible to web developers and data scientists alike.

## Key Takeaways

### For the Community
- Python's reach extends far beyond web development and data science
- Hardware programming doesn't have to be intimidating
- Accessibility in tech conferences makes events inclusive for everyone
- The Python community is incredibly supportive of new speakers

### Personal Growth
- **Confidence Building**: Successfully presenting despite hearing challenges
- **Technical Depth**: Deep dive into embedded systems and hardware
- **Community Engagement**: Connecting with fellow Python enthusiasts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Contributing back to the community that taught me so much

## Future Plans

This talk opened doors to more hardware experimentation and community involvement. I hope to:

- Expand the Shelfie project with more advanced features
- Write detailed tutorials about MicroPython projects
- Speak at more conferences about hardware + Python combinations
- Help make tech conferences more accessible for people with disabilities

## Questions and Discussion

Feel free to reach out on Twitter if you have questions about the talk, MicroPython, or accessibility in tech conferences. I'm always happy to discuss hardware projects and how Python can make embedded development more approachable.
