If you want to create an iterable of a fixed length in python, use `collections.deque` with the `maxlen` parameter.

```python
import collections

fixed_list = collections.deque(5*[None], 10)

# this is now a fixed list of items 10.
# by _appending_ more items, you'd be dropping items
# from the beginning.

fixed_list.append(1)
print(fixed_list)
```

Note that this merely calls `appendleft`.
