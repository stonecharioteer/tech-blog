How do you decide when to join a company, when to stay and when to leave?

I've worked at my fair share of companies, both _in_ and _out_ of the computer
technology space. I don't think I'm leaving companies because I have a problem
with consistency; in fact it's quite the opposite.

I'm a trained statistician. I worked on a motorcycle manufacturing shop floor
for 3 years of my early career, and compared to tech companies, that was _hell_.
However, the lessons I learnt there have moulded me forever.

The most important lessons revolved around statistical quality control and
process monitoring. I've written about
[control charts and statistical process control](/posts/2022/control-charts-primer)
in detail, but the key insight is that any process has measurable parameters
that can help you understand when things are changing for better or worse.

## When Do You Join a Company?

I'm dividing this article into two parts. First, think about why you'd join a
company. You've left an older company, and the reasons why are irrelevant -- for
now.

1. You've interviewed with a company, and this has involved anywhere from a
   couple of hours to weeks of your time. If this company has a lengthy
   interview process that requires a DevOps engineer to know how to invert a
   Binary Tree or how to write a Binary Tree where every node is a Linked List,
   then this process could also have taken months of your time.
2. You have an offer from them that cites _concrete_ numbers that you find
   attractive. Let's not kid ourselves, there's money involved. Money is
   _always_ involved.
3. You spoke to a couple of cool people who you _may_ work with, or at least
   grab a beer with at the office parties.
4. You also like what the manager seems to promise that you _may_ work on.

Think about those four points for a moment.

The first one is sunk cost. You've invested time into the process. You've
invested your effort. _Set this aside for now._

The second is money. Money. _Money_. You now have bragging rights on
teamblind.com and you can leave reviews on Glassdoor.com and levels.fyi,
improving the sample size for what is obviously a very positively or a very
negatively skewed chart.

The third is people. You have laughed with them during the interview. Perhaps
they were amazed at your data structures and algorithms prowess. Or perhaps one
of them told you that your installation of Pi-Hole and Unbound could be
improved; this happened to me, and I joined Merkle Science because I trust this
dude. This is an interesting point, but it _depends_ on what sort of a person
you are. It might not matter to you. Your colleagues are your colleagues, and
perhaps they're not going to be your friends.

The fourth is work. Actual work. You are promised a paintbrush and the Sistine
Chapel. However, it depends on your personal goals. Maybe you wanted to be a
sculptor and not a painter. Perhaps you wanted to write Rust and not Golang.

So when do you join a company? Perhaps, quite simply put, when one of them is so
convincing that you ignore the others. When I say _one of them_, I mean points
two to five. If you're joining a company because of the sunk cost fallacy, then
you have different problems, and you'll quickly move on to the next part of this
post.

## When Do You Leave A Company?

When you decide to leave a company, what pushes you out the door? There are
several things.

1. Internal politics; I know I've run away from that a couple of times.
2. Poor pay; Perhaps your manager cannot fight for your rightful worth.
3. Horrible work; Nothing pushes me out the door better than SharePoint and
   Oracle SQL.
4. Horrible boss; Perhaps he's not promoting you because of some reason you
   think is relevant.
5. Horrible peers; Perhaps you think your team members are not fun to work with.
6. Late promotion; You didn't get that promotion you were promised 18 months
   ago.

You feel like you could go on? Sure, I used to think the same thing.

But today I don't. I think there are only three reasons why you'd want to leave.
Actually there will only ever be two reasons why you'd want to leave.

1. Pay
2. People
3. Work

Wherever you go, whatever the company, there will only be these three things
that you need to decide whether to join the company, whether to stay there, or
whether to leave.

If you're running your own company, there will only be these three reasons that
you can use to hire or keep great people at your company.

But what about all the other points?

## The Three Control Parameters of a Career

This is where I come full circle with my control chart paradigm. The three
points that I brought up in the previous section have everything to do with
control charts. No, I don't need you to plot statistical charts to monitor them,
but you're already plotting such charts in your head, subconsciously.

Wherever you go, whichever the company, the only three things you will feel
changes in, the only three _control parameters_ you are granted, are pay, people
and work.

And this is a page I'm taking out of distributed programming, and the CAP
theorem.

{{< tip title="CAP Theorem" >}} The CAP theorem says that for any distributed
data store, you will never be able to achieve high consistency and high
availability when a partition occurs. {{< /tip >}}

Wherever you work, you will _never_, **ever**, achieve great pay, great people
and great work.

Wherever you go, strive to get _one_ great thing. Get great pay, great people,
or great work. _Just one_.

Of the rest, choose a place where one of them is _bearable_. You will find
places with **great pay and okay work**, or **great work and okay pay**, or
**great work and okay people**, or **great pay and okay people.**

And the last parameter? Well... it will _automatically_ be horrible.

It doesn't matter how great you think your company is. One of these three
features is going to be amazing.

You will love your work, you will find your colleagues okay to hang around, and
you will bemoan your pay.

You will love your pay, you will find your work palatable, and you will loathe
your collegues.

You will love your colleagues, you will find your pay acceptable, and you will
fear signing in every day because your work is pointless.

You will love your work, you will find your pay is acceptable, and you will hate
your colleagues.

You will love your pay, you will be able to withstand your colleagues, and your
work will be ridiculous in your eyes.

I could go on.

The point is that irrespective of your company -- _irrespective_ of your company
-- this will be true. If you want to join a company, or, if you want to stay at
a company, you must love one of these three things the company can give you, and
you must find one of the other two to be acceptable. You will _hate_ the third
thing, so make sure it's something you're not passionate about.

But as a hiring manager, or a CEO or CTO, what can you do? Make pay
exhorbitantly high and make the work amazing? No. That'll only attract
psychopaths who hate working together. Remember that the two things that matter
to people _vary_ from person to person. One employee might want amazing work for
mediocre pay - how do you motivate her to work on database administration if
what she loves is hardcore engineering? One employee might care about his
colleagues, he loves to discuss the technical aspects with a team that's the
sort you hear from on stage at Goto Conf and KubeConf, and he's okay as long as
the work is bearable. Pay doesn't matter to him. How will you try to attract
this sort of employee. Then there's the sociopath who wants amazing pay and
bearable work. He's not going to care about what sort of people he works with --
he'll be polite to them of course, but then he only cares about delivering
excellent work himself. What will you offer him?

So when do you leave?

## The Two Of Three Rule

You must definitely leave when two of the three control parameters are horrible.
Think of your job as a see-saw. On one side is the "great" control parameter,
and on the other is the "horrible" parameter. At the center is the fulcrum,
which can move either to the good side or the bad side. That's where the third
parameter is currently concentrated. And that's the important part,
surprisingly.

When this parameter is right at the center you realize that it doesn't really
make you super happy, but that it's also not annoying you constantly. It's a
fine balance between the great parameter and the horrible parameter.

Yes, it's not the "great" parameter, or the "horrible" parameter that decides
when you will leave. Instead it's a shift in the central parameter that you once
found _palpatable_, _bearable_ or _just okay_, when you joined.

When _that_ parameter shifts to the horrible side, it doesn't matter how _great_
the other parameter is.

Your pay could be astounding, but you will not be able to work on a horrible
project with horrible people.

Your colleagues could all be amazing engineers, but nothing will make you work
on stuff you _hate_ for peanuts.

Your work could be amazing and will revolutionize the world, but you cannot work
on it with people you do not get along with, for horrendous pay.

If two of these parameters are on the horrible side, it doesn't matter just how
amazing the other parameter is. Your constant annoyance at the other two will
upset you constantly. Indeed, the fact that a parameter you found just
_bearable_ and not an annoyance is going to annoy you multiple times more than
the other horrible parameter.

At any workplace, no matter how awesome, employees will care only about one of
three things. People, Pay and Work. One of these things will drive people to
join you, one of them will be something they don't really find disagreeable, and
one of them will be something they would rather not talk about with their
friends. If the one thing that they don't really hate tips too far to the other
end, people will leave, and improving the one thing that was the driving factor
will no longer make a difference.

{{< info title="The Two of Three Rule" >}} Pay, People, Work. Pick one that you
need to be awesome. Pick one that you don't mind being lack-lustre. The third
one _will_ be horrible. This rule holds at **every** company; indeed, it holds
at _any company_ you should and would work at. Shift the second factor, and you
won't want to work there, no matter how awesome the first factor you picked is.

The Two of Three Rule is: _Pay, people, work. Two of these three things will
either make you really love your job, or really hate your job._ {{< /info >}}

It's funny how this works.

When I was at Flipkart, I was paid to write about books. I am a voracious
reader, or I was at one point. I was being paid to write about J.R.R. Tolkien,
about Dr. Seuss, and about the Wheel of Time. Sure, there were moments I was
writing about horrible books that I feel aren't worth the paper they're printed
on, but that didn't matter to me. So the work was _okay_. The pay was _bad_. I
was earning peanuts before, and compared to that, this was okay pay, _bearable_
pay, but it was still _peanuts_. The people I worked with were _fun_ to work
with. I made several _friends_ among them, and I opened up to them like I never
had with others. I was able to have lunch with them and talk about their lives.
I was able to have heated discussions about comic books, about movies, and I was
able to be myself.

What happened though? Why did I leave?

One day, the Catalogue team decided to scrap the books content. The team leads
and the manager decided to tell me at the last minute. They didn't even sugar
coat that fact. That didn't really matter, but it was the fact that they treated
it as an afterthought that someone who constantly went on and on about how much
he loved books would be "relieved" that he didn't have to write about books
again. It didn't help that the news was also given to me by a team lead who was
hired despite being clearly incompetent. I was doing the job of both team leads
at that point. I had automated so much of their job, and they were really not
doing much. The manager didn't care about how much I was improving things.
Instead, they chose to pull the rug from under my feet.

I left as soon as I found a new job. I wasn't working with people I loved for
horrible pay and horrible work.

Then I went to GKN. I worked on some amazing projects, and I didn't hate the
people around me. Some of them are friends today, close friends who were there
for me at hard moments. Here, I got shafted with the pay once again. At one
stage, my salary was revised because I managed to prove to the HR how underpaid
I was -- this came under the threat of leaving the company. But it was still 30%
of my market value at that point.

But eventually, the people I cared about were making plans to leave, or move
away. And the people who were left around me became _toxic_. The local leaders
of my division were _toxic_, and that made my life hell. I couldn't hire
competent team members since I wasn't given power to do so.

I left within 3 months. I couldn't change their minds. I couldn't choose the
people I worked with, I couldn't build a team to build that amazing project my
German boss wanted me to build -- a project I still think about fondly.

Then I joined Visa. Here I got great pay. My colleagues were good people. And
the work was horrendous. I left in two years because that changed, and it would
have been sooner if not for The Great Pandemic of 2020.

I'm not explaining all of this to say that my workplaces were negative. No. I
still recommend Visa to all my friends who want a good place to work. Remember,
the _two_ things that matter to me out of the three might not be the same for
you.

Control charts tell us that there's something inherently wrong with a process.
When a process begins to deviate from its established "norm", it is slowly
progressing to a stage where if you want it to go back to how it was, or to
another _acceptable_ state, you need to exert considerable effort. Sometimes,
this won't be in your hands. This will instead be something you need your upper
management to step in and change. And, oftentimes, you'll find that they have no
horse in this race.

If you want to hire good people who will work for you for a long time and
deliver great things, ask them which of the three things matter to them, and
ensure that you meet those two things. The definition of a "Great Place to Work"
is multi-faceted. It is very different to different people, but you will find
that for a given person, these points are more or less the same unless they have
a life-changing event.

When I was at Visa, I lost my left ear due to circumstances not under my
control. Indeed, no one at Visa could have helped me. That changed the ball game
drastically. That's what is called a random error in a control chart. In such a
scenario, no one can help you really. In such times, as a leader, the only thing
you can do is try to be there for your employees. But as an employee, you need
to decide what matters to you and whether staying at a place will help you
achieve that sooner.

## Conclusion

So the next time you're evaluating an offer, or if you're evaluating whether to
leave a company or to stay; or if an employee is leaving and you're trying to
figure out how to convince her to stay, remember that money isn't always the
prime bargaining chip. Sometimes money doesn't matter. It's the other two that
upset the scale.

There are always two out of three things that make or break the experience of
working at a company. To me, today, that's money and people. Money because of
the responsibilities I have, and people because I don't just want a team, but a
_crew_. I want a _unit_ that functions together. The work is after the fact in
my opinion. To others, those scales are definitely going to be different.

you ever find yourself wanting to discuss these topics, I'm always available.
