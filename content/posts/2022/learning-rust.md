I've been trying to learn Rust for nearly 3 years now. Oddly, I find that the
process has been extremely similar to how I've learnt Python. I tried picking up
Python in 2010, and I couldn't. I tried again in 2015, and I was finally ready.
The process has been the same.

I have been using Rust for a little over 40 days now, and I've managed to write
a small webservice for Merkle Science. Granted, I _could_ have written this
faster in Python, I'm glad I got the chance to try Rust. The only reason I took
this long was because I wasn't experienced with Rust.

I've also spoken at BangPypers, wherein I discussed how I got into Rust as
someone who's only coded in Python. The audio is a bit choppy, I'm afraid,
because I was trying noise cancellation in OBS Studio.

I'm hoping to make more Rust content, but before I do so, I plan on writing and
reading more Rust code.

**Update:** I wrote a much more detailed follow-up post about my Rust journey:
[So Far So Rust](/posts/2022/so-far-so-rust/).
