## June 17, 2025

I was 17 when I failed school for the very first time.

I was in the 11th grade and if I'd continued at that school, I'd have failed in
12th, which is a whole lot worse, apparently.

I was studying at the Oxford Senior Secondary School (CBSE), and I'd done poorly
on all my subjects that year. Primarily, Biotechnology, which was promised to be
the "great big thing" that decade. I scoff at that now, and I hated the subject
and the teacher.

All my teachers hated me, and I suppose a large part of that had to do with
being a neurodivergent kid, but I will not claim I was a "nice kid". I was an
ass, and my attitude showed.

I failed that year, and my father took me out of that school and put me in the
state-board branch, the Oxford PU College, affiliated to the Karnataka State
Pre-University Board. I also got into some tuitions, and did fairly better. I
didn't do too well in the 12th grade, mostly because I got cocky and thought I
had it in the bag.

I, in fact, didn't have anything in the bag.

I got into Engineering, studying a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering because
my scores were so absymal in the exams that I couldn't get Computer Science like
I wanted. I was already neck-deep in computers. I was studying C and C++, I was
already using Linux as a daily driver because my old Pentium 4 CPU couldn't
handle anything more than Windows XP.

I did decent at Engineering, managing to top my class from time to time. I was
almost always within the top 3. I didn't fail any subjects, but I didn't realize
life had other plans for me.

After my Engineering, I failed to get a job, repeatedly. I joined the Indian
Institute of Science, where after a gruelling 6 months, I left after my
professor yelled at me for being too slow. I blamed him (only internally) for
not guiding me whatsoever. I remember him saying he wanted me to login to a
remote computer to run some simulations. I didn't know what he meant, and even
though someone showed me the `ssh` command, I didn't know what he meant.

I feel the irony from typing this in neovim, to tell you the truth.

I left IISc and spent about 5 to 6 months without job. A cousin got me a temp
role at Harita Fehrer Ltd, where I joined as a Quality Engineer (Temp), and was
paid in cash with all the wage workers. I was just happy to get paid.

I worked my way up, "failing" sometimes, and "succeeding" other times.

I consider moving from factory roles to a role as a content writer my biggest
success. Working at Flipkart where I was being paid triple what I was paid at my
first factory role, and then picking up Python to help the content team is still
my biggest win.

I worked my way up, and I think that sometimes I didn't always do my best, but I
showed up, repeatedly. I wasn't the smartest developer you could hire, but I
loved the craft and strove to build user-centric tools and libraries. I was
always sympathetic towards users because I have been befuddled by tools and
libraries that take this world for granted. I still facepalm when I come across
a github repo that has a couple thousand stars and doesn't have an elevator
pitch in the very first paragraph, or screenshots of what the UI looks like and
does.

So what am I writing about here?

I joined a company (Let's call them Company C) in 2025, and stayed there only a
month. I didn't feel like a good fit, and I left of my own accord. I don't know
what it was that made me feel everything in my gut tell me that it was a bad
fit, but I wanted to ponder about my time there and talk about how I feel about
failure.

Failure is a strange thing. I say this as someone who took months to learn to
swim and still doesn't consider himself comfortable in the water.

I don't feel like my time at Company C was a success. If anything, I feel like I
fell flat on my face. I remember wondering within my first two days there if I
was out of my depths. That still feels a little true, mostly because I came with
a ton of burnout at my previous job, but I also felt like I was watching a
process fail entirely.

I wondered a lot about this during my time at the job and since leaving it. I'm
not fully convinced about my thoughts, and I wanted to write this out in a post
so that I could share it with some friends.

Failing at a job is different from failing in school. It's not like there were
scores to measure. At school, my teachers were clear. _I_ failed. It took me
years of thought to wonder why they never questioned if _they, too, failed_ at
teaching me. At this job, I didn't fail. I wasn't a fit, and the interview
process failed. If anything, I didn't bother to question if this was a company I
wanted to be at, and they didn't question if I was someone they wanted to be at
their company.

There are still flaws to this thought process. I don't feel _bad_ after quitting
within a month. I am in no rush to go back to a job, and I want to take some
time to rejuvenate and address my burnout.

I know that some of my friends won't understand this approach, so I'm not going
to explain myself to them. This is mostly a record to myself so that I remember
what I felt when I quit Company C.

I quit because I didn't enjoy a culture of zero empathy for your colleagues and
users. This is a hard problem to solve and comes from hiring "hotshot
developers". I used to be one myself, but I've since realized that I don't want
to be one. I didn't enjoy the culture of working till 0400 every night, and the
unsaid expectation that if you weren't churning out AI-powered code, you were
not productive. I have always thought the lines of code are a poor metric to
optimize against, but I really don't want to compete in an environment where it
feels like my team is against me, not with me.

And, I've written this before, but I'll repost this on my new blog just so that
it's more accessible, I wish people would build units and not teams. It's sad
that Company C wasn't focussed on that. They had a hot product that they could
realistically reach for the moon with, but they are faltering to get up to speed
just because they're not functioning together. They're trying to 1Up each other,
and this shows in their code.

I feel _disappointed_ if nothing else, that I couldn't sniff that out. I left
after seeing that the company didn't offer me at least two of three things. I
only got money, no semblance of good people or work. I didn't belong, and
neither did they.

## September 5, 2025

I've been thinking a lot about my career and how I feel right now. It's
September, and I left Company C after a little over a month there in the first
week of June.

I have struggled with burnout for a while now, a little over 2 years. I started
at my previous company, ChainSafe, in November 2022, and I can tell you for
certain that I did nothing of note there.

It isn't me being insecure, or me having Imposter's Syndrome, but it's the raw
truth. I didn't have anything to do at ChainSafe, and I also grew complacent. I
didn't spend time learning, I didn't spend time studying, and I certainly lost
my creativity as a result.

I wondered what the point of it all was, when I wasn't using any of the things
I'd learnt by myself in a silo when I was at GKN Aerospace. I worked there for
3.5 years and built _wonders_. I ran an Elasticsearch-powered search engine for
the company by myself. I built tiny applications that made other engineers ask
me to build more each week, and every week I had an "app of the week" request
from my German manager.

I was making things that made me happy, and eventually, that joy left me by the
time I was at ChainSafe. I also surrounded myself with people who would tell me
"why do you bother", because they couldn't fathom why I did these things. My
natural creativity tanked, and so did my cognitive acumen.

I felt slower than I was. I felt like I was unable to think coherently.
Self-reflection led me to believe I had cognitive disabilities and I let the
thoughts of others shoehorn themselves into my own.

It is an odd thing, failure. I have written about it before, but this time, it
feels oddly intimate. I have failed in many things before, but I've also always
been the person to think my way out of things. I think from 2021 till 2025, I
began a decline that I am only now trying to fight back.

Someone once asked me how I managed to think my way out of things, and I think
there was a certain level of privilege to my success as well. I was lucky, and
at times I think I was luckier than I deserved to be. I didn't use said luck
good enough, and my career has signs of survivor bias.

A part of me also tells me that my career has ended because I didn't keep up
with AI over the last two years. I had a chance to, but I was... unable to
focus.

## September 26, 2025

It's been 25 days since I wrote the previous note, but I wanted to expand on
what's been going on since then.

I attended PyCon India 2025 and IndiaFOSS 2025. Both of these helped me a bit,
but I think it was mostly unrelated to the conferences themselves. I thrive in
tech conferences. I'm a loud extrovert there. So much so that sometimes I wonder
if I should have been a DevRel. I know I cannot keep that energy up, but it
helps me know that there's a crowd out there who I love to interact with.

I'm learning Ruby these days. I have put my distributed systems learning on
pause to do so, because I'm trying out a temporary role at a company. I like
what they do, and they asked me to learn Ruby because that's what they use.

Learning Ruby is teaching me a lot about myself, and I think that it'll add to
the list of things that heal me. That list is rather personal and I don't expect
it to help anyone else, but if you're close enough to me for you to have seen
this article, ask and I'll talk about it in person.

I'm doing a lot better than I was when I started this year, my anxiety is under
control and my interest in technology is alive again. I think I will continue to
do better, and in time, I might look back at this and be able to articulate what
went on.

## January 8, 2026

It feels strange to say I'm still failing and I feel okay. I bombed an interview
at Tensorlake, I felt horrible even before the interview because that was my
dream role, something I wanted to work on. I look up to people like Brendan
Gregg, and I tell people that's what I want my career to be. I want to be a
performance engineer, the person you go to to squeeze every inch out of an
application by designing its architecture for scale. There is no one size fits
all, but this is what excites me. I'm never usually interested in the product I
work on, it's more about the scaling problem, the issues about moving large
data. I love building developer facing tools, and that's where my forte is. Or
at least that's where it was headed.

I meandered. At my current job, I'm a round peg in a square hole. I'm shoehorned
into a role that I do not fit into. I am going to leave, I've made up my mind.
It's a great company, and the team is great, but that role isn't for me. I know
what I want now, and that's why I'm also making a
[direction]({{< ref "posts/2026/direction.md" >}}) document. For the moment,
I've failed, I've had to stop an interview even though the interviewer was
helpful enough to support me. I felt really lacking while talking to him. My
knowledge of first principles has addled thanks to the burnout, and my skills
are in hibernation.

I had a panic attack because of this, and I'm not willing to compromise my
health just because I'll get some paycheck. I need to move on.

I will pick myself up again, and I'm going to focus on what to study next.
Oddly, I knew, even last year. It's what I want to do.

## January 29, 2026

I've said my farewells at Chatwoot. I feel really sad about leaving this
company. I like the people, but I wasn't in a role that followed the direction I
want to take my career. I wish I can work with them in the future some day, even
for free. It would be fun to help them. I'd consider it payback, honestly.

This document is unlisted here in my blog and I've been thinking about whether I
should just make it visible front and centre. There are companies that would
perceive that poorly. Today, someone told me that having left Composio in 40
days and Chatwoot in 4 months is bad on my profile. It was someone I consider
knowledgable in this industry, but what he doesn't understand is that I cannot
lie to my core. Lying to my values and my core will kill me. I cannot do that. I
think I'll find a job when I'm ready. I'm not done studying. I couldn't study at
all today since I was busy being pensieve about my last day here. I'm handing
off my laptop tomorrow, and I think that I will be anxious about not having a
job again. It's not a good time to feel this way, but I need to focus and study
the topics I've originally had on my list. Joining another startup without a
plan will lead me down a similar path. I don't regret having joined Chatwoot. I
met some lovely people. I just regret joining it solely because I needed a job.
I forgot that every time a company interviews you, you interview the company for
the role they're hiring for.
