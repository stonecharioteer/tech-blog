## Articles & Blogs

### 1. Julia Evans [jvns.ca](https://jvns.ca)

All of Julia's articles are _gold_. I recommend reading 5 a day.

### 2. Brendan Gregg [www.brendangregg.com/](https://www.brendangregg.com/)

Brendan's articles on performance and his talks across the tech world are really
solid.

### 3. Giles Thomas [gilesthomas.com](https://www.gilesthomas.com/)

I particularly love
[his articles on Sebastian Raschka's Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)](https://www.gilesthomas.com/llm-from-scratch).
They're ongoing as of this post, but I hope he gets around to finishing them.

### 4. [Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)

This article is part philosphy and part advice on a life in programming.

## Podcasts and Videos

### 1. [Rich Hickey Talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZdCLR02grLrEwKaZv-5QbUzK0zGKOOcr)

Rich Hickey's talks throughout the years are _inspiring_. I love listening to
them from time to time, especially the one on
[Hammock Driven Development.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)

### 2. [PyCon 2017 - Sam Agnew - Hacking Classic Nintendo Games with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75rNdPukuI)

I love this talk because it was one of the first talks to inspire me about how
to structure talks in a conference.

### 3. [Alex Petrov - What Every Programmer Has to know about Database Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V667vJzDvt4)

Watch this if you're dealing with databases. Alex's book is really good as well.

### 4. [Martin Kleppmann's Distributed Systems Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB)

If you're reading the book, I thoroughly recommend his video lectures as well.

### 5. [Jon Gjengset's Rust Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo)

Jon's videos on Rust are solid, _intermediate-to-high_ level content about Rust.
It's what we need more of!

### 6. [anthonywritescode](https://www.youtube.com/@anthonywritescode)

Anthony Sotille's videos on Python are like Jon's videos on Rust in a sense. He
talks about some libraries you could be using all the time without realizing it,
and he also digs through the internals of these. The videos are usually under 10
minutes and they're great for when you only have a short time every day. I
remember binging through these during the pandemic.

### 7. [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode/featured)

These videos are gold for getting through Leetcode-style interview preparation.
I have purchased a one year subscription to his course, and he's really good at
giving you a strong understanding of what's going on in every problem in under
15 minutes. I'm not sure if his courses are really worth it, but his youtube
channel is solid and I've wanted to support him.

### 8. [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/)

Talk Python is one of my favourite podcasts out there. I've been listening since
2018, and I really enjoy Michael's interview style.

### 9. [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/)

Python Bytes is Michael's collaborative podcast with Brian Okken, and these
episodes range around 15 minutes. Byte-sized, if you will!

### 10. [Test and Code](https://testandcode.com/)

Brian's standalone podcast Test and Code is also about python and excellent.
Binge through all 3 of these every week to get your python news and trends.

### 11. [Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/)

Rust needs more podcasts and video tutorials. Sadly, the Rustacean Station is
one of the only Rust-centric podcasts I have found consistent. There are other
channels but they're lacking in quality. (Jon Gjengset's videos are not really a
podcast.)

### 12. [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm)

I don't do any Javascript these days, but Syntax helps me stay on top of JS
trends. I don't listen as often as I'd like, but it's fun to tune in every now
and then. Wes Bos has an excellent set of tutorials that I've bought, and Scott
Tolinski also has some great tutorials on his website.
